The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.The group was founded 12 years ago by charismatic cleric Mohammed Yusuf. Police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the Internet.Boko Haram is now led by Abubakar Shekau.In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.What was agreed upon in the ceasefire deal?Nigerian officials said on October 16 that President Goodluck Jonathan's government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram after a month of negotiations.But officials provided few details about the release.Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, did not specify when the girls would be freed. He said not all would be let go at once, but a 'significant number' would be released soon.The Nigerian government had also consented to some demands by Boko Haram, but Okupe declined to provide details.Boko Haram has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring Chad last week. Nigerian officials have emphasized there is no set time line for release of the girls, which likely would happen on a piecemeal basis instead of all at once.So is there actually a deal?David Cook, who studies jihad, wrote on October 18 that he had doubts about a deal going through.'It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled President, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,' he wrote in an analysis for CNN.'While Boko Haram has suffered some reverses during the recent past, there is no indication that the group has suffered any mortal damage. The most plausible interpretation of the truce is that it is a bought one (probably in tandem with the Cameroonian release of captives), and that Boko Haram is merely using it (assuming that it holds to the truce at all) as a respite in order to regroup.'In an article written for CNN the day after Nigeria announced the ceasefire, Brookings' Richard Joseph wrote: 'This is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe.'What has Boko Haram done since Nigeria announced the truce?Boko Haram gunmen kidnapped at least 30 boys and girls from a village in northeast Nigeria during the weekend.Last week Boko Haram militia kidnapped 60 women and girls in two Christian villages in neighboring Adamawa state, according to residents and community leaders.The heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted Saturday, suggesting that they would be taken as sex slaves, residents told CNN.Then on Friday and Saturday, heavily armed Boko Haram gunmen invaded the town of Mafa in Borno state and seized 30 boys and girls, local leaders said.'They took them away to their base in the bush, and we believe they are going to use them as foot soldiers,' Mafa local government chairman Shettima Maina said.Mallam Ashiekh Mustapha, the local chief of Mafa who confirmed the abductions, said the kidnappers also stole 300 cows from the farming community in the raid.The Nigerian government has said Boko Haram has denied involvement in the kidnappings, but the group has issued no public statement on the issue.Are Boko Haram and Nigeria's government really interested in peace?Richard Joseph argues that 'the campaign for the Nigerian presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat Boko Haram.''If the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with Boko Haram and bringing home these girls, Goodluck Jonathan would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts.'In July last year, Professor of African History and Peace Studies at the University of Ibadan Isaac Olawale Albert wrote an opinion piece for CNN in which he argued that Boko Haram had no reason to pursue peace.'Leader Abubakar Shekau and some of the group's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace -- especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As they await eventual capture, they will not mind causing more trouble,' Albert said.Director of the Royal African Society Richard Dowden noted in May that President Jonathan had not commented on the schoolgirls' abduction for two weeks after the incident.The reason, Dowden argued, was that the problems of the northeast region did not matter to his government as there was no incentive to develop the region. 'It produces nothing and will not vote for President Jonathan,' he wrote.Why did Boko Haram abduct the girls?Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, told CNN in May that the mass April abduction and other recent attacks were messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram followers in Islamic schools will be avenged. In 2012, Shekau's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody.Sani said he believed Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of Boko Haram followers from prisons.'The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible,' he said.But at least some of them may be traded for ransom money. Boko Haram has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a French family kidnapped in northern Cameroon last year and reportedly freed for some $3 million.The international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves Shekau. 'It has put pressure on the government to reach out to him,' Sani saidShekau is not beyond negotiating with the Nigerian government, despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of President Goodluck Jonathan's legitimacy. According to the International Crisis Group, negotiations in Ivory Coast a year ago were on the verge of producing 'an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire.'Then Shekau was designated a terrorist by the U.S. State Department and abandoned the talks.What are the chances of the girls' safe return?Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram with the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm, said in May that the mass kidnapping may have been part of an effort by Shekau to reinforce the loyalty of largely uneducated recruits by providing them with 'free servants or sex slaves.''Many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it's a real horror and over the next years we'll slowly hear the stories of girls few-by-few as they manage to make it out,' Zenn told CNN.'Boko Haram has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups,' and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack, he said.However, if the ceasefire announcement is real, it would appear the girls are alive, leaving hope for the chance of their return.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:38:14Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028085819-newday-vo-sesay-boko-haram-00004013-story-top.jpg", "id": 3734}, {"title": "Denmark offers some foreign fighters rehab without jail time -- but will it work?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/28/world/europe/denmark-syria-deradicalization-program/index.html", "text": "Aarhus, Denmark (CNN) -- When Omar left home in 2013, his parents thought he was going to help out at a refugee camp for the victims of Syria's brutal civil war. But the soft-spoken Danish student wasn't on a humanitarian mission -- he had joined the ranks of a jihadist brigade fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.But Omar -- whose name has been changed to conceal his identity -- soon realized that what he was seeing on the battlefield was different from what he thought he'd signed up for.'The place I was in, there was some chaos between different groups and there was violence between different groups,' Omar, who is in his early twenties, told CNN. 'I went there to fight Bashar al-Assad and not to fight other Islamic groups.'Omar didn't want to be a part of that. Fed up with the infighting, he decided to return home.In 2013, a U.N.-sponsored panel declared Denmark the world's happiest place to live, citing a number of factors including life expectancy, social support and the freedom to make life choices. But the wealthy Scandinavian country is also becoming known for something altogether more worrying -- one of Europe's highest rates of jihadi fighters.At least 100 Danes are believed to have left the country to fight in Syria and Iraq. Of 25 countries CNN surveyed last month, only three had a higher proportion of Muslims leaving to fight.The country is facing a dilemma: what to do when these fighters come home?Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city, thinks it has the answer -- a controversial program for rehabilitating jihadis returning home from Syria that doesn't necessarily involve jail time.Here's how the program works: Any returning fighter is eligible for help getting a job, a house, an education, and psychological counseling -- just like any other Danish citizen.Those returning must be screened by police, and anyone found to have committed a crime will be put through the courts and possibly prison.The program does not try to change the fundamentalist beliefs of the returning fighters -- as long as they don't advocate violence.Aarhus seems to have an especially acute problem with foreign fighters. More than 30 young people -- including Omar -- left the city last year to fight in Syria. Sixteen of them have since returned.Omar was pursuing an engineering degree at university before he went to Syria. He has been there twice since.Omar said he wasn't nervous about coming back home. Unlike in some other countries, it is not a crime in Denmark to fight in Syria.'It wasn't illegal to fight in Syria unless you fought for a group that was a terrorist organization,' Omar explained. 'It was not a big deal for me to come back and get back to the daily life I had before I left.'Omar knows the people who run the de-radicalization program, but he hasn't joined it because he doesn't think he needs help reintegrating into society. But some of friends have joined the program and are satisfied with it.Police here say it's a Danish solution that's not particularly special -- it's simply a crime prevention program with a focus on jihadis.'We can't just put young people in custody because they plan to go to Syria,' explained Aarhus Police Commissioner Jorgen Ilum. 'It is not illegal according to Danish law to go to Syria, but we could try to persuade the young people not to go to Syria.''We could tell them about the risks that they might encounter going to Syria. We could tell them about the Danish legislation that makes it illegal to participate in direct terrorist acts and if they did do they might be punished when they come back. We could offer the parents and young people the mentoring help or help from psychologists in order to get some tools in how to deal with this problem.'Of the roughly 30 people that left Aarhus for Syria last year, 22 had some sort of association with the city's Grimhojvej Mosque, according to Ilum. Sixteen have since returned back to Denmark.WATCH: Why are there so many jihadis from Denmark?The mosque has come under severe criticism from right-wing Danish politicians who say Grimhojvej's leaders are trying to radicalize their followers. Some have even called for the mosque to be closed down.Mosque officials told CNN they were surprised that so many of their members had left for Syria -- but said they had been working with police on the best way to approach young Muslims.'The only and the most important thing that we want to see is that they don't consider us as criminals,' said Oussama El-Saadi, the mosque's chairman. 'They don't consider us as terrorists, and they recognize us as minority living in Denmark and will continue living in Denmark and that we are a part of this society.'El-Saadi said young people from his mosque started traveling to Syria because they wanted to make a difference. And El-Saadi refused to condemn the brutality of the radical Islamist groups -- like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra -- that are running rampant in the war-torn country.'We are here in Denmark, so far away from the area around there,' he told CNN. 'We are not condemning or supporting any group down there because we don't have the information.'El-Saadi said that jihadis returning to Denmark were probably turned off by the infighting between the various Muslim groups battling for control of Syria, or that they simply wanted to return to a more normal life of school and work.The Danish program lies in stark contrast to the approach of the United Kingdom. Fighters returning to Britain often face surveillance, terror charges, and jail time.Officials say that roughly 500 people living in the UK have left to fight in Syria and Iraq. Britain is also looking at measures to ban fighters from returning home under the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPims). There is fear that returning fighters might carry out terror activity at home.WATCH: Is de-radicalization possible in Britain?Omar criticized Britain's approach to returning jihadis. 'The UK government treat the people in a harsh way compared to Denmark,' he said. 'They start taking away people's passports and start harassing them by raiding their homes, taking some of them to prison and these things.''I have spoken to a lot of Western people in Syria and nobody has ever talked about getting back to plan to bomb these countries, as they try to make it sound like in the media.'There are several de-radicalization programs in the UK -- mostly aimed at preventing people already in Britain from becoming radicalized -- but none specifically targeted towards citizens returning from Syria. In 2008, the British government spent 140 million on countering extremism. That has now dwindled to just 1.7 million.A spokesman for Britain's Home Office told CNN: 'We take the risk of those returning from Syria very seriously. Some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation.''In the UK we work with our partners, including the police and health service, to determine how we can best support returnees from areas of conflict and help them successfully reintegrate into society.'So does the Danish method actually work? Jorgen Ilum seems to think so.'I should say that in 2014 I can see after we started this contact dialogue with the mosque and the youth center, only one [person] to our knowledge has left to Syria -- in comparison to 30 in 2013 before we had this contact,' Ilum said.Ilum said Danish fighters have to be motivated to be productive members of society. 'We see it as a very important crime prevention effort to try to reintegrate these people back into the society,' he said. 'Many of the people who come back, they are rather disillusioned about what they have seen in Syria. It's not what they had expected or heard or seen over the internet.''What we have seen is out of the 16 that have returned ... 10 of them are now back in school and have a job -- it seems to us that their focus is on something else other than Syria.'Preben Bertelsen, a professor of psychology at the University of Aarhus, has been involved with the city's program for the last two years, providing counseling to returning fighters. He is aware the program might not work for everyone.'If [someone] doesn't want our help, we can't really reach him,' he told CNN. 'All of these youngsters are screened for criminal acts out there. If they have done something like that, then the other part of society -- police enforcement -- will take over.'It's too soon to know whether the program will be a success in the long term. But police say the alternative would be fighters that return and simply disappear. This program is designed to help while also keeping a close watch.'Young people have a lot of feelings. So if you are going to be humble towards those returned fighters, they will be humble towards you. If you are going to be harsh towards them, they are going to be harsh towards you. This is how young people think,' Omar said.In the meantime, Omar says he will keep working to complete his education -- and that he plans to go back to Syria after graduation.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:37:43Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028140552-denmark-uk-deradicalization-chart-story-top.jpg", "id": 3723}, {"title": "US and South Korea delay troop command transfer", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29737826", "text": "The US will maintain control of South Korean troops in the event of war with the North, the two sides say, delaying again a long-planned command transfer.Both sides attributed the delay to 'an evolving security environment' and an 'intensifying' threat from Pyongyang.The transfer had been due to take place in 2012 and was then delayed until 2015.

But as weeks became months and prospects of the schoolgirls' release seemed slim, the social media campaign slowly dwindled.But one man, Alasholuyi Kehinde, did not stop fighting to bring the missing girls home.Almost every day, for 186 days, the Lagos, Nigeria, resident took a photo of himself holding up a sign pleading with the world not to forget about the Chibok schoolgirls. A father of three and marketing professional, Kehinde felt a responsibility to advocate for the missing girls and their families. He posted the images on CNN iReport each day.Now, Nigeria has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Islamist terror group Boko Haram, which took credit for kidnapping the girls back in April. The girls are expected to be released shortly, although Nigerian government spokesman Doyin Okupe says 'it is a process. ... It is not a question of hours and days.'With the end of the kidnapping ordeal in sight, Kehinde shares with CNN why he didn't give up hope as the campaign faded.CNN: When you first started taking photos, did you know you were going to take a photo every day?Kehinde: I never knew I would still be carrying the Bring Back Our Girls placard six months after the schoolgirls were abducted. I had thought the girls would be back soon, especially when a couple of countries were pledging support to help rescue them. Day 20 was when I started taking photos, because it was so shocking and heartbreaking. Now we're up to day 186, and the story is the same, the girls are still not back.CNN: What inspired you to keep participating in the #BringBackOurGirls campaign?Kehinde: I believe the Chibok parents whose children were abducted need our support during this agonizing time. I am a father of three kids. If I am away from my kids for two or three days, I always feel like there's a vacuum. So, I felt like we must advocate for these parents. We must join our voices with theirs and demand for the safe return of their abducted children.CNN: Did you tell others about what you were doing?Kehinde: I did get awesome support from people all over the world through various social media platforms. They kept encouraging me to keep holding on, and to not give up when many others have since given up.CNN: How did the people in your community respond when the girls were first abducted?Kehinde: Initially, there were some who didn't believe such a thing could happen. Some people just couldn't fathom more than 200 innocent schoolgirls being violently taken all at once. That was huge. It was unbelievable. The realization dawned on many when the government confirmed the abduction to be true.CNN: Do you think people in your community still care?Kehinde: The support for the parents of the abducted schoolgirls in my community is awesome. We are all united in our demand. We are asking and pleading with the Nigerian government to please do more to ensure the safe release of the abducted schoolgirls.CNN: What are your thoughts about the government's effort to get the girls back?Kehinde: I believe the Nigerian government has been doing everything possible within its limit to ensure the girls are safely rescued. But I believe the government could do a lot more better than what it has been doing. Six months after the kidnappings, we are now hearing about negotiations for the release of the missing schoolgirls. But we have lost some valuable time in the process.CNN: Is the community hopeful that the schoolgirls will be returned?Kehinde: Everyone is anticipating, expectant and praying it is true. Some are waiting to pop champagne.CNN: Do you think the girls will ever get rescued?Kehinde: Fingers are crossed that hopefully the girls would be reunited with their families. I am hopeful, and I believe that one day, the girls would be freed.

'We stopped him as he was about to leave Canada for terrorist actions. He was questioned when he was arrested. We have not been able to determine any real threat at this time.'On Monday, Couture was driving a car that hit two members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were walking in a strip mall parking lot in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, said David Falls, spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.One soldier died and the other was injured. The suspect led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town, southeast of Montreal, Falls said. Police said the man exited the car before officers shot and killed him.Months ago, his parents had seen a change in their son's behavior and asked authorities for help, police said.'He was identified as a potential important threat,' Fontaine said. 'His Facebook profile showed that he was about to leave the country and that he was radicalized. We met him several times. We worked with the imam of the mosque he was going to.''It is very difficult when a person prepares an act alone and uses a vehicle as a weapon,' he said.Police said there are about 90 people in Canada classified as important threats. Bernard Lamotte of the RCMP said a unit formed in 2003 keeps an eye on potential terrorist activities.'Each threat is taken seriously,' he said. 'The threat that represents the Islamic State is taken very seriously.''We are still investigating on the radicalization among Canadians,' Fontaine said.

That prompted a plea from his parents, who had maintained silence about his capture since he was taken hostage.'We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe,' the family said then.In the days after ISIS threatened Kassig, his parents pleaded with his captors to show mercy and free him.

We get one shot at this and we don't get any do-overs, and for me, it was time to put up or shut up,' he said in a 2012 interview with CNN.He joined the Army in 2006, deployed to Iraq the next year and was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour. He returned to the United States, got married, then divorced and eventually decided to help victims of war in the Middle East.Kassig founded a nonprofit group to provide first-response humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees, his family has said.

The dead belonged to the Albu Nimr tribe, known for its fighting skill.Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Washington hasn't been able to confirm those figures, but 'we have no reason to doubt their authenticity.'The latest incident came Saturday when 75 members of Albu Nimr were taken from their homes and killed in the desert near the town of Hit, said one of the tribe's leaders, Sheikh Nabil Al-Ga'oud.It has been unusual for ISIS militants, who refer to themselves as the Islamic State, to kill women and children.'We are not surprised by their actions,' Al-Ga'oud told CNN. 'Their religious leaders have given them an order to kill all of our tribe and take everything that we own because we are fighting against ISIS.'He said nine children and six women were killed in Saturday's attack.A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department condemned the ISIS attacks.'This proves, once again, that (ISIS) does not represent anything but its warped ideology and provides more evidence, if any were needed, why our coalition partners, including Iraqis from every background, must work together to defeat these terrorists,' Jen Psaki said at the department's daily briefing.The Albu Nimr, who number in the tens of thousands, are ready to fight to take back the town of Hit, Al-Ga'oud said Saturday. The city was seized last month by ISIS fighters after weeks of fighting the tribesmen.Hit and neighboring Ramadi were holdouts in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province after ISIS swept in from Syria, taking town after town in the western province. Albu Nimr tribesmen were among those who fought them until they began running of out weapons and supplies.Al-Ga'oud said an attack is 'imminent,' adding that 'we are getting the support we need,' in an apparent reference to backing by Iraq's central government.A 2003 Brookings Institution report observed that, though most Iraqi Sunni tribes were loyal to Saddam Hussein in the days when he ran the country, the Albu Nimr tribe had mounted a protest against the former Iraqi strongman in 1995 after the execution of a noted member. The protest was put down by paramilitary forces loyal to Saddam.In general, however, Saddam respected the Albu Nimr.Since Saddam's fall, they've been tapped to oppose al Qaeda in Iraq. They were also part of last year's Sunni uprising against the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government.They have been fighting ISIS but say they haven't received much support from the Iraqi government and international coalition members.Kirby said U.S. advisers were working hard to improve the competence and capability of Iraq's army.'The Iraqis are pushing back. They are going on an offensive against (ISIS) throughout the country,' he said.

By nightfall, no shots had been fired, but the situation remained very tense, officials said.The Sunni militant group Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, has been on the offensive throughout Anbar Province in recent weeks. It has scored a series of tactical victories and bedeviled the Iraqi security forces and their coalition partners, who have had limited success in reversing the militants gains.Islamic State has tried twice in the past month to lay siege to Amirayat al-Falluja, about 10 miles south of Falluja, but the Iraqi police and military, in collaboration with members of the Albu Esa tribe, blocked their advance.Conquering Amariyat al-Falluja would not put Islamic State closer to the capital; the group has occupied an area farther to the east, within about 12 miles of Baghdad International Airport, for several months.But controlling the area would give the fighters a strategic advantage over an important transportation corridor that follows the Euphrates River and connects two Islamic State strongholds: the nearby city of Falluja, which the group has controlled since the beginning of the year, and a region in northern Babil Province, south of the capital, where they have held ground since the summer.We are ready to fight them, Arif al-Janabi, head of Amariyat al-Fallujas police station, said Wednesday.The recent string of Islamic State victories in Anbar Province began with the successful onslaught last month of the Saqlawiya military base, followed closely by the defeat of a garrison in the village of Albu Aitha, also known Albu Etha.The Islamic State, following several days of fighting, then gained effective control of the town of Hit about two weeks ago. The victory was complete when, over this past weekend, several hundred Iraqi troops stationed at a training base outside the town were redeployed to Al Asad Air Base, to the northwest of Hit. Iraqi officials called the move a tactical retreat.Iraqi forces have also been locked in near-continual clashes in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, since the summer. In recent days, Islamic State fighters have been able to penetrate the city from the west and on Wednesday were pressing in from the north and south, said Taha Abdul Ghani, a member of the provincial council.The Iraqi military command deployed about 500 soldiers and police officers to Ramadi on Monday to reinforce troops stationed there.The reinforcements arrived with artillery and an armored unit that included tanks, said Ahmed Hamid, head of the security commission for the Anbar provincial council.

They were reportedly given inadequate care and told not to talk about what happened.'From 2004 to 2011, American and American-trained Iraqi troops repeatedly encountered, and on at least six occasions were wounded by, chemical weapons remaining from years earlier in Saddam Hussein's rule.'In all, American troops secretly reported finding roughly 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs, according to interviews with dozens of participants, Iraqi and American officials, and heavily redacted intelligence documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.'The United States had gone to war declaring it must destroy an active weapons of mass destruction program. Instead, American troops gradually found and ultimately suffered from the remnants of long-abandoned programs, built in close collaboration with the West,' the newspaper reported.It quoted a former Army sergeant who suffered mustard burns in 2007 and was reportedly denied hospital treatment.'I felt more like a guinea pig than a wounded soldier,' he told the Times.Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby on Wednesday addressed the allegations at a press briefing in Washington.When asked whether injured U.S. servicemembers were denied treatment, or told to keep quiet, he said he couldn't speak to 'what guidance or decisions their unit commanders or medical staff may have given them at the time.'He added: 'I just don't have that level of detail. This happened a long time ago and it was on an individual basis.'Kirby estimated that about 20 U.S. servicemembers were exposed to material from chemical munitions, from around the mid-2000s to 2010 or 2011.'The Secretary's expectation is that servicemembers and their families are going to get the care and support that they need, and if they aren't, he wants to make sure that leadership address that,' Kirby said about U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.'But this is an issue for their chains of command to deal with, leadership at all levels to deal with. There's no need for -- and I don't expect that there's going to be -- a Pentagon-level review of these particular cases,' Kirby said.The newspaper suggested several reasons why the U.S. government might have wanted to suppress the chemical weapons finds.For one, in five of the six cases in which troops were wounded by chemical agents, ' the munitions appeared to have been designed in the United States, manufactured in Europe and filled in chemical agent production lines built in Iraq by Western companies,' the newspaper reported.For another, the weapons were old -- made before 1991 -- and therefore did not back up U.S. intelligence that at the time suggested Iraq had an active weapons of mass destruction program.'In case after case, participants said, analysis of these warheads and shells reaffirmed intelligence failures. First, the American government did not find what it had been looking for at the war's outset, then it failed to prepare its troops and medical corps for the aged weapons it did find,' the Times reported.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-16T04:14:59Z", "top_image": "", "id": 1381}, {"title": "A Missing Ally Against ISIS", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/10/14/a-missing-ally-against-isis", "text": "As the Islamic State attacks the Kurdish town of Kobani on Syrias border with Turkey, the U.S. has pushed the government to help fight the militant group.

Canadian terrorism expert Tom Quiggin explains how the country is facing a growing problem with extremism.The sergeant-at-Arms of the Canadian Parliament, Kevin Vickers, shot dead an assailant who was intent on killing members of parliament in the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.Minutes earlier, a Canadian Forces soldier was killed at the National War Memorial.The attacks hit at the heart of Canada's symbols of public life. Attendance at recent War Memorial ceremonies has soared, reflecting widespread Canadian public respect for the military.Canada has now suffered two terrorist attacks in two days.The first attack on 21 October resulted in the death one Canadian soldier and the injury of another.The assailant's social media postings show he was clearly inspired by IS propaganda.The timing of the second attack, combined with witness reports, suggest a similar influence, although no claims of responsibility have emerged.Many in Canada are now asking: is this a case of 'one off' violence inspired by IS, or does a larger problem exists?While they are still in the minority, Canada is home to a number of extremists who preach radical views.They have been creating a political space where promoting violence both at home and overseas is becoming acceptable.Previously, extremist voices such as the Egyptian Canadian Ahmed Said Khadr, who was suspected of links with al-Qaeda, counselled that violent jihad overseas was required, but that violence in Canada was to be avoided.This has now changed.Over the past years, a number of young Canadians have departed to be suicide bombers, IS soldiers and terrorist attackers.Last week, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated that they had 63 national security cases linked to terrorism involving 90 suspects. Those include people who intend to go overseas to fight and those who have returned.Canada, much like the UK and other European countries, has allowed a steady stream of extremist individuals, money and ideology to enter the country.Since the 1980s, these individuals have set up front groups and charitable organisations to accomplish their goals.Over the past few years, four of these charities have had their status revoked for funding terrorism. These include the World Islamic Call Society of London, Ontario, in 2011, which was involved with Col Muammar Gaddafi's Libyan Jihad Fund.From these centres of extremism, a conveyor belt system exists for radicalisation that exploits vulnerable youth who respond to the messages of al-Qaeda, Hamas, IS and others.Examples of this were Xristos Katsiroubas, 22, and Ali Medlej, 24, both from Ontario, who were key figures in the gas plant attack in Algeria in January 2013.Canada is now faced with the question of how it should respond to the spread of extremist ideologies.The first line of attack could be to remove charitable status from the front groups.To date, a limited amount of progress on this issue has been made in Canada.For example, the International Relief Fund for the Afflicted and Needy-Canada was listed as a terrorist entity in April after it was accused of channelling money to Hamas.The Islamic Society of North America Development Foundation had its charitable status revoked after the Canada Revenue Agency accused it of distributing funds to a group linked to another group listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and the government of India.However, more than 20 charities in Canada remain that are believed to be fronts for extremism.The UK recently launched a study into the Muslim Brotherhood to better understand the nature of the group.At this point, Canada needs to have a similar national-level inquiry into both violent and non-violent extremists who are developing values which run contrary to the Constitution and the Charter of Rights.Tom Quiggin is a member of TSEC - the Terrorism and Security Experts Canada network.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-23T02:45:34Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78466000/jpg/_78466136_024430196-1.jpg", "id": 3085}, {"title": "U.S. Marines out of Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.hlntv.com/article/2014/10/27/us-marines-out-afghanistan", "text": "There are no more U.S. Marines serving in Afghanistan.On Sunday, the last remaining unit lowered the American flag and transferred control of a massive military base to the Afghan military.All of Britains combat troops also left Afghanistan on Sunday, leaving just the Afghan army and police to fight the Taliban.More from CNN: UK formally ends combat mission in AfghanistanToday's must-see, must-share stories are in the daily speed feed.Morning Express with Robin Meadeairs Monday through Friday at6 a.m. ET onHLN.

Previously, prosecutors charged him with a single count of providing material support to terrorists.According to the indictment, Khatallah conspired with others 'on or before Sept. 11, 2012' to attack the U.S. diplomatic post. 'He believed the facility was being used to collect intelligence, that he viewed the U.S. intelligence actions in Benghazi as illegal,' the document said.'These additional charges reflect Ahmed Abu Khattalah's integral role in the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, which led to the deaths of four brave Americans,' said Attorney General Eric Holder.The indictment doesn't say how much planning was involved, and doesn't account for the possibility that the attack coincided with other attacks elsewhere in the Muslim world that targeted U.S. diplomatic facilities.Republican critics have said the Obama administration failed to take sufficient measures to prevent the attacks. They also criticize officials for initially portraying the terrorist rampage as spinning out from street protests blamed on an anti-Islam movie produced in the United States.Khatallah has pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists and will remain jailed until his trial, a federal magistrate ruled in July. He will be arraigned on the new charges on October 20. Ten of those charges, including murder, could carry the death penalty.Authorities contend that Khatallah is a senior leader of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the two-pronged armed assault.Khatallah remained free for more than a year after the attacks, doing interviews with CNN and other media, prompting criticism of the Obama administration over how long it was taking to arrest the alleged attackers.He was arrested in a military raid in Libya in June and charged in federal court in Washington, D.C., mere yards away from Capitol buildings where he has become the center of political controversy.Assistant Attorney General for national security John Carlin said in a statement Tuesday that the case 'highlights our resolve to find and hold terrorists accountable wherever they may hide.'Prosecutors say the attack in Benghazi began around 9:45 p.m. with Khatallah and about 20 armed men attacking the main gate of the diplomatic mission. They set fire to buildings and Khatallah and others allegedly turned away emergency responders. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and Sean Patrick Smith, a mission employee, perished from wounds suffered in that attack.The attackers retreated briefly around 10:15 p.m., according to the indictment, and then an hour later launched another attack on the mission's southern gate. They used assault rifles, rocket propelled grenades and other explosives.The attackers plundered what they could from the compound, then shortly after midnight, the indictment says Khatallah and others retreated to a camp operated by Ansar al Sharia.Khatallah then led the attacks on the CIA annex beginning at 12:30 a.m. and again at 5:15 a.m., according to the indictment.

'We are sorry.'At a news conference on Thursday, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau was not linked to the Muslim convert who on Monday killed a Canadian soldier in Quebec in a hit-and-run attack.However, Zehaf-Bibeau was trying to get a passport to travel to Syria.Mr Paulson said: 'I think the passport figured prominently in his motives.'", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T03:43:36Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78494000/jpg/_78494818_7r45ohbf.jpg", "id": 3322}, {"title": "Syria conflict: '200 air force strikes' in 36 hours", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29720384", "text": "The Syrian military has stepped up air strikes on rebel areas dramatically, carrying out more than 200 in recent days, opposition activists say.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the raids took place mostly in western areas between midnight on Sunday and noon on Tuesday.The UK-based group said there were many casualties, but did not give a figure.The intensified strikes come as US-led forces continue to bomb Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria and Iraq.US and Arab jets have been attacking IS positions around the northern Syrian town of Kobane, where Kurdish fighters are under siege.In an interview with the BBC, the US special envoy for the global coalition to counter IS defended the airdrops of military supplies into Kobane despite some of them ending up in the hands of the jihadist group.John Allen said only one of 28 bundles of small arms, ammunition and other weapons supplied by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq might have ended up in the hands of the militants.Shortly after he spoke, the Kurdistan Parliament approved the deployment of about 120 Peshmerga fighters to Kobane.Turkey signalled on Monday that it would allow Peshmerga to cross its border with Syria. It has refused to allow Turkish Kurds to do so.The BBC's Kasra Naji, who is on the Turkish side of the border, says it is unclear when the Peshmerga will arrive. Officials say they will bring heavy weapons - something Kurds in Kobane say they desperately need.The Syrian air force's strikes targeted rebel-held areas in Quneitra, Deraa, the Damascus countryside, Hama, Idlib and Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory said.The provinces stretch from the country's south-west through the capital, Damascus, to the far north-west.The eastern province of Deir al-Zour, where government forces have been battling IS militants, was also bombed over the same period.At least eight people were also reportedly killed on Tuesday in an air raid on a rebel-held town along Syria's southern border with Jordan.The Local Co-ordination Committees, an opposition activist network, said government planes had dropped explosives-laden canisters on Nassib.On Wednesday, warplanes carried out 10 strikes on the towns of Murak and Kafr Zaita, in Hama province, the Observatory said.The Syrian Observatory says the air force carries out 12 to 20 strikes a day on average so the 210 that took place over 36 hours represent a rapid increase.Analysts said the military might be stepping up its air campaign in an effort to weaken rebel groups before they began receiving training and equipment from the US and its allies so that they can take the fight to IS on the ground in Syria.In a separate development, Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said the Syrian air force had destroyed two of three fighter jets seized by IS.The jets were bombed as they landed on the runway of the Jarrah air base in the eastern Aleppo countryside, Mr Zoubi told Syrian TV late on Tuesday. The air force was searching for the third jet, he added.On Friday, activists said IS militants had flown the jets over Aleppo with the help of former Iraqi air force pilots.Mr Zoubi also said Syrian army and air force had been providing military and logistical support to the Kurdish fighters in Kobane, despite not being part of the international coalition fighting IS.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-23T02:40:24Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78451000/jpg/_78451593_78451166.jpg", "id": 2930}, {"title": "FULL TRANSCRIPT: Ali Larijani  Amanpour", "url": "http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/15/full-transcript-ali-larijani/", "text": "What follows is a transcript of Christiane Amanpour's full conversation with Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani.CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Mr. Larijani, welcome to the program.ALI LARIJANI, CHAIRMAN, PARLIAMENT OF IRAN (through interpreter): Thank you.AMANPOUR: Let me first start by asking you about the threat of ISIS. There are many reports that the group is very close to Baghdad, could threaten the Baghdad airport. What is Iran doing to defend itself and Baghdad from ISIS?LARIJANI (through interpreter): You know, ISIS was not a group that was created on its own. We have to get to the root causes and we have to know that big powers, the responsible for its creation and also some countries of the region. But it seems that right now some of the big powers have come to the conclusion that what they did was wrong. But those countries of my region that used to support them, give them money and provide weapons and ammunition to them, it seems that they say that they do not accept this group anymore and they are now part of the coalition. But it seems that they aren't really serious about ISIS. And it seems that they have not come to the belief that they are going to be a problem to them, too. And I think it is very unlikely to destroy guerilla fighters by just dropping bombs on their heads. I have also heard that the Americans are going to find two places, two bases in the region in which people will be trained for ground operations. Our assessment is telling us that this is not going to solve the problem. This itself is going to be a new problem in the future. But us, I mean, Iran went to the side of the Iraqis very early when the crisis broke out. We don't really want to broadcast it. We don't want to go to the media and talk about what they did for the Iraqis, but in practice, we defended them.AMANPOUR: My question was: is Iran satisfied that it can defend itself and Baghdad against ISIS?LARIJANI (through interpreter): We have to accept that terrorism is an international issue and is very important. It is not just about one country. You know that in the first place the big powers tried to create some forces in Afghanistan to stand against the occupiers and by that I mean the former Soviet Union. But as time went on, they did not, or they could not, manage these groups. And this is something which has happened in the last two decades in my region. The Americans start something but after some time, they fail to control and contain it.LARIJANI (through interpreter): But they are not the only ones to blame; there are countries in my region who contributed to them. And those countries that are supporting the terrorists are actually opposed to democracy. So they're going to use this tool, this instrument that is terrorism. Of course, we know the solution. Terrorists cannot be destroyed by bombing them. You cannot solve terrorism by occupation. And in order to fight them effectively, you have to choose another method. And you know that we have good experience in that because we have actively fought against them.AMANPOUR: So can you spell out the other method? And are you talking about politics?LARIJANI (through interpreter): I don't think that something which has to do with security can be solved through politics. Of course, politics and political things can be helpful. But there is a security related solution to this problem.AMANPOUR: Could you spell out the security related solution to this problem that you have in mind?LARIJANI (through interpreter): Yes, I can spell it out to you. But in that case, you will be helping the ISIS.AMANPOUR: Well, let me assure you, Mr. Larijani, that none of us want to help ISIS. So as you yourself have said, there is no solution by air bombardment alone. Many inside Iraq are calling for American troops to help them. In Hit, in the Anbar province, where they're losing their towns, they are calling for American troops to help them. What would - what would you say if American troops or other boots went in on the ground to stop Daish, which is also your enemy?LARIJANI (through interpreter): You know, in order to fight ISIS effectively, you have to come up with a very good security solution. Part of it can be a ground operation. And the people who are going to be there on the ground should be skillful enough. And these people should not be like mercenaries. They need to have enough motivation to do that. And they need to get the training or be equipped according to the area or the territory in which they're going to fight. So we have to come up with appropriate designs and plans for this kind of operation.AMANPOUR: So you mean the mostly Shiite militia that you and Qasem Soleimani and the Revolutionary Guard are helping now in Iraq? Is that correct?LARIJANI (through interpreter): Not necessarily. I think people - I mean, Iraqis and Syrians themselves are capable enough to carry out such operations themselves. We know these people, whether Shias or Sunnis or Kurds in those two countries, they have what it takes to be successful on the ground. I think the best thing that the U.S. can do is to prevent its allies, its friends in the region, from sending arms and money to these groups. It is not a child's play. I mean, fighting terrorism is not a child's play. It can be very costly. On this there are ulterior motives involved in this.AMANPOUR: Mr. Larijani, the United States has asked its allies to stop doing that. We will see what happens. But as you said, part of this is political. When it was absolutely necessary in Iraq, Iran allowed Prime Minister Maliki to move out of power. The same is being asked about Syria. Are you ready to see a situation where President Assad moves aside in order to have a reunited, comprehensive political solution for Syria, where Daish also is very active?LARIJANI (through interpreter): I think Syria's case is not that simple. Suppose that someone else replaces Mr. Assad. So what is this person going to do when most of the country is under the control of ISIS? In Iraq, there is this democratic structure in place. So why is it that the ISIS is still there? This phenomenon is a security problem. And the solution has to be a security one too. It is like a person is so hungry and is famished and he needs to eat food, but you ask him to go and have some air outside. Yes, fresh air is good too. But right now, this person needs food. We do definitely support democratic structure to be established in Syria. In Syria we just had an election, yes, we can say that some parts were being controlled by ISIS. But again, we can have another election. But first we have to solve the security problem. I'm telling you very clearly that if we just satisfy ourselves with these types of solutions that some countries are offering, then very soon Syria will - Syria will be in a situation that is going to be much worse than Libya.AMANPOUR: OK. Mr. Larijani, I want to move on to the nuclear negotiations, which are about to have a new round of discussions in Europe this week. The president of Iran, Mr. Rouhani, said that he believes a deal is possible by the November 24th deadline. Do you believe that that is possible? And would the Iranian parliament - you are the speaker of the parliament - accept the deal that is being worked out now?LARIJANI (through interpreter): I think it is quite possible. Of course, this providing that both sides are serious enough about reaching a deal. I think the remaining issues or the outstanding issues can be resolved by the - that deadline, November 24th. But I think it will be unlike to achieve a deal if both sides keep bargaining over small things.AMANPOUR: Are you satisfied with the interim deal so far?LARIJANI (through interpreter): It has its own advantages and disadvantages. It was a small step.AMANPOUR: So if there is no possibility of reaching a final deal by November 24th, would you accept a continuation, an extension of the talks under the current deal, maybe locking in some of the progress made under the interim deal?LARIJANI (through interpreter): We have to discuss about this internally. We don't want to do something to just keep us busy for a while. We have to sit down and talk about the possibility you just talked about.AMANPOUR: What do you think the results will be if there is a total breakdown and no extension?LARIJANI (through interpreter): I don't think that is going to be very much in favor of the U.S. Because it means that they have lost the opportunity to achieve something diplomatically. Of course, it is going to be a loss to others as well. We are going to do whatever we have been doing. We do not want to develop a nuclear bomb. But we insist on having access to nuclear technology and know-how. And we are ready to be transparent enough about it. You know, it makes me surprised that why is it that in these negotiations there is just talk about the number of centrifuges? Or how they can limit our R&D aspects of the nuclear technology? I think that is not really important, the number of centrifuges. The important thing is that Iran is trying to be transparent and Iran is going to be clear about its program.AMANPOUR: Mr. Larijani, you said that if no deal is reached by November 24th, you'd have to go back and discuss whether there would be an extension. But my question to you is as speaker of the parliament, the very powerful position in Iran, would you support an extension? Do you think an extension is better than a total collapse and to go back to the situation of one year ago?LARIJANI (through interpreter): I dont think there is need to get back to the past or to one year ago, as you said. I mean, a step has been already taken. The important point is that is 5+1 willing to take only smaller steps, even if it takes 10 years? Or is it better to solve the whole matter in one go? I think the latter is beneficial to both sides. I mean, this can positively affect other areas. Maybe the others want to prolong this process and favor smaller steps.AMANPOUR: Can I move on to the internal situation inside Iran? We have been monitoring very closely the number of Iranian Americans, Iranian English people who have been jailed over the last several months. Let me first ask you about a young girl, Ghoncheh Ghavami, who is Anglo Iranian and she's in jail since June, I believe. Will she be released? What do you say her crime is? She has not been charged.LARIJANI (through interpreter): Of course, I cant confirm that the number of these people jailed is rising. These are very rare cases and this is very natural for these cases to happen, because Iran is a very big, large country, with a population of 80 million people. They have - might have done something wrong or committed an offence and the judiciary has to look into it. There should be no doubt that we don't want to send anybody to jail with no good reason. As far as I know, there has been an investigation opened into the case. And I hope that this will come to an end and be concluded as soon as possible.AMANPOUR: Well, she is on hunger strike now, so her health may be in jeopardy. And obviously many, many people outside of Iran are watching what happens with these young people. And as I say, no charges have been filed against Ms. Ghavami. Let me ask you about a colleague of mine, a fellow journalist, Jason Rezaian, who is also in jail. Recently his wife was released. We are very grateful for that. Jason Rezaian has had no charges put against him. We would like to know why he's in jail and will that case be expedited?LARIJANI (through interpreter): It seems that I don't have as much information as you do, because you say that no charges have been LARIJANI (through interpreter): - leveled against him.AMANPOUR: - nothing public has been said.LARIJANI (through interpreter): You're right. You know, according to the rules and the laws in Iran, the charges cannot be publicly announced before an investigation is done. Of course, laws are different in different countries. As far as I know, there are some charges against this person, but they have not yet been made public because of those laws I told you about. But this case is being processed as we speak.AMANPOUR: I just want to tell you a story and wonder whether you might take something from this. Of course, your brother is the head of the judiciary in Iran. And we had a colleague, Maziar Bahari, who was jailed after the 2009 elections in Iran. He spent four months, 118 days, in solitary confinement. It turns out that the principle charge against him was a comedy show in the United States. He was involved in a comedy show - nothing real, but a comedy show. And therefore I wonder whether we need to explain to the judiciary in Iran that some of these things that they may think are real are not actually real so that they don't keep targeting journalists.LARIJANI (through interpreter): These are the questions you have to put to the judiciary people because I don't really know much about these cases. Maybe there are other things involved in these cases that you don't know about. I cannot give you a straight answer right now because I am not in charge of matters like this. But let me tell you that the judiciary in Iran is totally independent and the judges have enough power and authority to judge independently. Not even the head of the judiciary can issue an order to a judge and force him to do something against his will, because this is also mentioned in the constitution.AMANPOUR: But would you agree that these cases should be expedited?LARIJANI (through interpreter): Definitely expediting is good. Even explaining about them as much as the law allows us. But we should not really put - force the judiciary to rush things.AMANPOUR: On that note, Ali Larijani, speaker of the Iranian parliament, thank you very much for joining me from Geneva.LARIJANI (through interpreter): Wish you all the best, all of you.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-10-15T15:47:31Z", "top_image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/amanpour.jpg", "id": 888}, {"title": "Can Canada preserve its openness?", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29747807", "text": "A gunman's rampage through the Canadian parliament has focused attention on how the country protects its institutions. Will the attacks affect its cherished openness?Ottawa's lockdown may have been over by the time the sun rose over the Canadian capital, but lines of yellow police tape still stretched across the road in front of Parliament Hill as armed officers stood guard.Over the street, rows of squad cars blocked the National War Memorial, where a gunman shot and killed a soldier before rampaging through the parliament building.By the standards of most Western cities, these security measures appeared restrained in the wake of a deadly attack.But in a nation where the openness of political institutions is a deeply-cherished article of faith, they were a sign that something was out of the ordinary.Normally, security around Parliament Hill is far from draconian.Most days the public are free to walk across the lawn that stretches in front of the Centre Block. On sunny days visitors play ball games or relax on the grass. In the summer months there are lunchtime yoga classes.Political protesters, too, commonly gather on the green.'I've always been very proud and think it's absolutely amazing that you can walk up and kind of feel democracy when you go up to our parliament buildings,' says lawyer Lucy Chislett, 26, who works nearby.Getting into Centre Block - the complex's main building - requires a pass.Visitors wait in line to go through airport-style security scanning. Public parking is not permitted, but members of the public can wander through car parks that surround the building.Security at the site is the responsibility of Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer who has been hailed for his heroism after witnesses identified him as the man who shot the attacker.Those protecting the complex and its occupants include officers from the RCMP Parliament Hill Detachment, the House of Commons Security Services and the Senate Protective Service.The service personnel who stand guard at the National War Memorial - as Cpl Nathan Cirillo was doing before he was fatally shot - carry unloaded rifles.How did the gunman get in?It's not yet clear how the gunman got past security at Centre Block. According to CBC, witness Scott Walsh reported seeing a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun jumped over the stone wall that surrounds Parliament Hill.According to Walsh, the gunman then forced a driver from their car at gunpoint before driving to Parliament's front door and firing at least two shots.In 2012 a report by the auditor-general's office warned that there were flaws in the complex's security that needed to be addressed.These included potential confusion arising from having four different police forces (the RCMP, Senate Protective Service, House of Commons Security Services plus the Ottawa police, which patrols streets nearby) in charge.For many Canadians, the contrast with the security around politicians and key buildings in the United States is a point of pride.'Canadian prime ministers don't run around surrounded by men in black suits - they've always tried to present themselves as close to the people,' says Prof Christian Leuprecht, a security expert at the Royal Military Academy of Canada.'Parliament has always been fairly open access.'Indeed, there appeared to be little appetite on Ottawa's streets for tightening security around Canada's democratic institutions.'It might seem a little bit less inviting starting today, but I don't think that'll last very long,' says policy analyst Peter Nasr, 35, who works close to Parliament Hill, as he looked across the police tape.'We don't want to make this sort of thing feel normal.'Wednesday morning's shootings will undoubtedly lead the authorities to examine their procedures.It's not the first time the site has been a target.In 1966, Paul Joseph Chartier, who was armed with 10 sticks of dynamite accidentally blew himself up in Centre Block .The buildings were evacuated in 1989 when a hijacker fired at American tourists from a coach nearby.A man drove a Jeep up Centre Block's steps in 1997, stopping just before he crashed into the doors.In 2006, police foiled the so-called 'Toronto 18' plot to launch a suicide attack on the hill.There's nothing the authorities can do, Leuprecht says, to prevent parliament buildings becoming a target for violent extremists.He says the handling of Wednesday's events will be judged effective by security agencies. Security measures at Parliament Hill had previously been tightened in the wake of the 11 September attacks, he says.'The response was very effective,' he says. No-one else was killed after the first shooting and the building's elected officials were protected, Leuprecht adds.Following the attacks, Mr Harper pledged 'to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies'. But he also insisted that 'Canada will never be intimidated'.There was a sense on the streets of Ottawa, too, that surrendering the city's cherished openness would be to hand victory to those who sought to undermine the nation's democratic foundations.'It's a tragedy, but I hope that we come together and react in a way that's not going to allow these people to win and further restrict liberties and everything that we stand for,' says Chislett.'Even though people are fearful, I hope this doesn't change what we stand for and all the values that we still hold.'", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:51:39Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78486000/jpg/_78486961_024441160-1.jpg", "id": 3140}, {"title": "Obama sends 1,500 troops to Iraq", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/07/politics/obama-sends-troops-to-iraq/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is sending up to 1,500 more soldiers to Iraq to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight ISIS, in a deployment that would almost double the total number of American troops there to 2,900.The White House said in a statement that it will also ask Congress for another $5.6 billion to fund the fight against ISIS. The troops will not have a combat role, and will operate from bases outside Baghdad and Erbil.To date, Anbar province and Taji district have been considered as two likely locations for operations centers outside of Baghdad and Erbil. CNN reported last week that the military was preparing plans to deploy U.S. advisers to Anbar, much of which is under the control of ISIS.'The President took these decisions at the request of the Iraqi Government and upon the recommendation of Secretary Hagel and his military commanders based upon the assessed needs of the Iraqi Security Forces,' the statement said.'We believe this request is an opportunity for Congress and this Administration to work together to provide the additional resources needed to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL and I look forward to working with Congress to secure this funding,' said Shaun Donovan, Obama's budget director.The budget request marks an early test for cooperation between Obama and congressional leaders following the Republican rout in this week's midterm elections that reshaped Washington's balance of power.It includes $1.6 billion to establish a fund to develop and support Iraqi and Kurdish security forces as they gear up to mount a counter offensive against ISIS, which has carved out a so-called caliphate in vast swathes of Iraq and Syria.The requests are based on an assessment of Iraqi security forces made by US Central Command, said Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby.CENTCOM will set up training centers for nine Iraqi army and three Kurdish Peshmerga brigades, Kirby said.He said that Obama took the decision to go ahead and almost double the number of trainers and advisers following a request from the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. He said that the mission was possible because Iraqi forces, which were built with billions of dollars in US funding, and partially folded in the face of the ISIS advance, had 'stiffened' their spines.'We are going in at the request of the Iraqi government. We are wanted there,' said Kirby'There is a very acute threat that is facing the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government.'The White House has insisted that the US operation against ISIS will not include 'boots on the ground.' But the new announcement by an administration that made ending foreign wars a core of its foreign policy is likely to fuel new concerns of 'mission creep' among the president's critics.But Steny Hoyer, Democratic House minority whip, told CNN's 'The Lead with Jake Tapper' that he would back the funding.'I don't think this is mission creep,' he said.A Republican congressional source complained that the administration had not formally briefed senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the new funding and troop request.Howard 'Buck' McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services committee, said that he would consider the request, but warned that the president's strategy to combat ISIS was insufficient.'I would urge the President to reconsider his strategy and clearly explain how this additional funding supports a new direction. Such clarity is more likely to find swift congressional approval,' he said in a statement.The top U.S. military commander in the fight against ISIS insisted on Thursday that airstrikes are working to erode the radical Islamic group's capabilities.'I'm confident we're having the desired effects,' said Army Gen. Lloyd Austin.He said that ISIS fighters were afraid to congregate in any sizable formation in Syria and Iraq amid fears they could be target by US and allied aircraft.A senior US defense official meanwhile told CNN this week that the administration had not ruled out expanding the war in Syria to another radical group, the Al-Qaeda affilitated al-Nusra.Such a move would be intended to repel its advances against moderate Syria rebels on which Washington has anchored its strategy of battling ISIS.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:24:46Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141107171720-tsr-dnt-sciutto-more-us-troops-to-iraq-00003207-story-top.jpg", "id": 5676}, {"title": "Despite Boko Haram ceasefire, kidnapping continue", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/23/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-kidnappings/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire that will supposedly lead to the release of more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram, members of the Islamist terror group have abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.The heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kolanuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted Saturday, suggesting that they would be taken as sex slaves, residents told CNN.The latest abductions in the villages of Wagga and Gwarta raise serious questions about recent Nigerian government claims that more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram in April would be released soon as part of a ceasefire with the Islamist militants.Boko Haram has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring Chad last week. Nigerian officials have emphasized there is no set time line for the release, which will likely happen on a piecemeal basis instead of all at once.Boko Haram, meanwhile, has let its weapons do the talking, continuing five years of violence. Over the weekend, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town, killing at least eight people and kidnapping others.Residents of Wagga, near a town where more than 200 girls were abducted in April, told CNN that heavily armed fighters stormed the village Saturday and took away 40 women by force.The gunmen went door to door, seizing women and young girls and driving off in vans and motorcycles with them into the bush, resident Lazarus Baushe said.Enoch Mark, a priest from Chibok whose daughter and niece were among the more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April in Chibok, said he received a call from an elder in Wagga on Saturday with word of the 40 women being abducted.In Garta, another 20 women were abducted, and three people were killed, resident Solomon Bature told CNN.Residents of Pina, a nearby village, managed to escape into the mountains before the gunmen arrived, resident Bulus Maiyaki told CNN. Maiyaki said two residents were shot and killed.David Cook, who studies jihad, has doubts about the ceasefire deal going through.'It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled President, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,' he wrote in an analysis for CNN.The Islamists have employed particularly bloody tactics this year, killing thousands.Boko Haram has gone after Christians, foreigners and educated people, driving them out of the country's northeast. And they have continued kidnapping.They have often sidelined Nigeria's army. And government soldiers have at times mutinied, complaining of lacking support from the government.Boko Haram has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:15:39Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141023151856-bpr-sesay-captive-nigerian-girls-latest-00003711-story-top.jpg", "id": 3462}, {"title": "La madre de Kassig vuelve a suplicar por la vida de su hijo a ISIS  CNN en Espaol: Ultimas Noticias de Estados Unidos, Latinoamrica y el Mundo, Opinin y Videos", "url": "http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2014/10/25/la-madre-de-kassig-vuelve-a-suplicar-por-la-vida-de-su-hijo-en-un-tuit-a-isis/", "text": "Parents of Abdul Rahman Kassig Request Instruction from the Islamic State pic.twitter.com/7auWNPa5t4", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:19:50Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141003165709-02-peter-kassig-story-top.jpg", "id": 3548}, {"title": "Egypt: The first 100 days of Sisi", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29178076", "text": "Former field marshal Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has been president of Egypt for 100 days. He was elected in May 2014, almost a year after he removed his predecessor, President Mohammed Morsi, from office.While some Egyptians celebrated the possibility that Mr Sisi would bring stability to their country, others feared that a return to the authoritarian security state that prevailed under Hosni Mubarak.Here, Egyptians give their views on how the country has changed since President Sisi took office.Despite the positives of this last 100 days, I would like to see the country controlled by law.But the situation remains as it is. There is an absence of security and laws are being breached all the time.There has been an increase in kidnapping and terrorist attacks. And the continuous electricity faults are making many Egyptians very angry.We cannot see any alternative solutions.The price increases resulting from the gradual removal of subsidies have also caused many people to suffer. They don't understand that this change is to help the economy develop.No-one can deny that the Egyptian president has started a great project. The Suez Canal development project promises to be great for the country.In addition to that he has restored Egyptian pride among Arab countries, and he has improved relations between Egypt and Russia.Egypt could be in a worse position, we could be in ruins like Syria and Libya, but we have been protected from disaster.The current government has made catastrophic mistakes in its management of the country. But they are still considered to be mistakes made by the government and not by the militia.There are problems - it seems to me that the government is appeasing the Islamists, the prime minister cares about ridiculous issues and al-Sisi has the image of a soft and kind president, not a strong and deterrent one.But despite all that I will never forget that we could be in the same position as Syria and Iraq without his intervention.Egyptians haven't gained anything over the last 100 days. All we have received are verbal promises, while the media sell us the idea that al-Sisi is the saviour.Electricity, health, transport, water and security - none of these problems has seen any real improvement.There has been an unacceptable increase in electricity faults.The economic projects that he announced, such as the Suez Canal development project, new opportunities for foreign investments and new school buildings have given Egyptians hope but not a real reward.Instead we have seen an increase in the price of fuel and basic needs.At the same time he is asking businesses to donate to the country's projects.He should be using the law to refund money that has been stolen from us.All that has happened so far gives me the impression that we are heading towards another Mubarak era, one that includes economic growth without equitable distribution.Since al-Sisi became president he has faced many problems.We have problems with terrorism as terrorism is now everywhere.We have problems relating to the supply of service such as gas, electricity and water.But in my opinion despite all of that he is taking quick steps towards reform and development.He has launched the Suez Canal development project, the development of roads and bridges, he has established the scientists' council, and has improved Egypt's image globally assuring co-operation with the international community.He also worked on reconciling different sections of Egyptian society.He is a president who is trying to reform the country and he is doing a great job in facing all the challenges.I think Egyptians are hopeful their problems will end soon.The achievements that have been fulfilled during the last 100 days couldn't have been achieved in years without al-Sisi.Most of them, such as the Suez Canal development project, are projects that existed a long time ago, but no-one had the courage to implement them.There has also been an improvement in security compared to situation in the last four years, especially for Christians.Al-Sisi not only moved the vendors from the main streets in the downtown area but he relocated them to other places. He solved the problem for good.On the other side, we still suffer from the bureaucratic routine in the government's institutions, and I also feel he is neglecting the poor and is not helping to support them.The Egyptian government is insisting on using force to deal with the banned Muslim brotherhood.The Muslim Brotherhood do not want to compromise in order to re-integrate in the society.Instead its members are insisting that ousted president Morsi is returned to power.The police use violence against them, but their actions also affect the freedom of the other Egyptians.The police use security problems as an excuse to prosecute activists and to limit the freedom of the civil movements that oppose the government's policies.The Egyptian government seems to be weak and doesn't have vision.They have made many decisions that have lead to a negative impact on ordinary citizens.I think don't think they know how to get out of this crisis.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T03:44:00Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3340}, {"title": "Robert O'Neill, ex-SEAL, says he shot bin Laden", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/06/politics/seal-bin-laden-shooter-identified/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill said in an interview with The Washington Post that he was the one who fired the final shot to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011.The 38-year-old Montanan also said that other SEAL team members were involved in the raid, including Matt Bissonnette, who detailed the group's experiences in his memoir, 'No Easy Day.'O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions before -- but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult.'I didn't think I would survive,' he told the Post.He said it was clear that Bin Laden had been killed and not merely injured from his shot when he fell to the floor with a split skull. Before he was shot, bin Laden 'had his hands on a woman's shoulders pushing her ahead,' O'Neill recounts, likely to deflect the attack.CNN's Barbara Starr confirmed from a U.S. official that O'Neill was on the raid. Two Special Operations sources confirmed to CNN's National Security analyst Peter Bergen that O'Neill was one of the shooters in bin Laden's room -- but others in the military community have wondered whether he can claim to kill bin Laden since there were at least two others in the room who fired weapons.The Navy SEAL had previously revealed details of the mission to Esquire magazine. But he was hesitant to attach his name to the account until his identity was linked to the story on a military blog earlier this week without his consent. O'Neill also said his secret was known by members of Congress and some news organizations.He also told the Post that he received a positive response from the families of 9/11 victims when he identified himself as bin Laden's killer to them.'The families told me it helped bring them some closure,' he said.O'Neill's move to go public is a controversial one, as it violates an unspoken military rule: Don't seek attention for your service.'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain,' said an Oct. 31 letter to the Naval Special Warfare ranks from commanding officer B.L.

The Ottawa attack heightened fears that Canada, a strong ally of the United States in its campaign against the Islamic State militant group convulsing the Middle East, had been targeted in a reprisal, either as part of an organized plot or a lone-wolf assault by a radicalized Canadian.Law enforcement authorities in Washington said their Canadian counterparts had identified the assailant as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who had changed his name from Michael Joseph Hall, and said he had been a convert to Islam. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said he had a criminal history of offenses that included robbery and drug possession.Downtown Ottawa, ordinarily bustling on a workday, was both shut down and traumatized as police officers rushed to secure the Parliament building, move occupants to safety and hunt for what they initially said could be two or three assailants. The lockdown at Parliament dragged into the evening, when armed officers began herding people who had been confined all day into city buses, but the emergency was not lifted.At a news conference, the Ottawa Police Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to specify how many more gunmen, if any, they might be seeking, adding to the foreboding in the city, where anxiety ran so high that a National Hockey League game was postponed. The police told reporters that the situation was dynamic and unfolding.The soldier died at a hospital, and the gunman was killed inside the Parliament building, Chief Charles Bordeleau of the Ottawa police said. The soldier was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, a member of the army reserves from Hamilton, Ontario. Chief Bordeleau said two people, whom he did not name, were injured, although not seriously.The shootings came amid heightened concern among Canadians about terrorist attacks. Two days earlier, a radical jihadist ran over two soldiers at a strip mall in a city south of Montreal, killing one of them.Prime Minister Stephen Harper, an outspoken critic of the Islamic State movement and other militant groups, had been expected to introduce new antiterrorism legislation on Wednesday. We will not be intimidated, Mr. Harper said in a television address Wednesday night. He linked the attacks to radicalism inspired by the Islamic State and called them despicable.As members of Parliament gathered for their weekly caucus meetings in the Parliament buildings on Wednesday morning, much of the city was looking forward to the hockey game here between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Ottawa Senators. Then everything suddenly changed.At 9:52 a.m., calls flooded into Ottawas 911 system to report a shooting at the war memorial, which sits isolated southwest of Parliament Hill in a square ringed by busy roads. Television images showed passers-by trying to revive Corporal Cirillo before an ambulance arrived. His service rifle lay by his side.Afterward, a video image taken from a dashboard camera and obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation showed the gunman getting into a car behind the war memorial.Although motor vehicles cannot drive onto Parliament Hill, a complex of three buildings surrounding a vast lawn used for national celebrations, without passing through a security inspection, there are numerous unguarded pedestrian access points.After dealing with reporters who had buttonholed members of Parliament as they entered their meetings, Greta K. Levy, the New Democratic Partys caucus press secretary, and a colleague headed out to her office by way of the large brass doors at the base of the Peace Tower that dominates the center block of Parliament.We heard someone yelling, Gun! Gun! and we flattened ourselves down on the top of a step, Ms. Levy said Wednesday evening. After it seemed as if nothing had occurred, Ms. Levy looked up to find herself staring at a man walking calmly and carrying a rifle or a shotgun aimed forward at his hips.He was clearly looking in our general direction  we were two or three feet away  I dont know at what, Ms. Levy said. I didnt notice anything in his eyes, nothing in his expression.Seconds after the gunman disappeared into the building, Ms. Levy said loud, prolonged gunfire broke out. A tourist crouched beside them, she said, bursting into tears and saying that her children were inside.The three eventually fled across the lawn toward Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruisers.Inside the building, the situation was confused. Numerous people told reporters that they had initially thought there might be a fire.A video taken by a reporter for The Globe and Mail showed a number of House of Commons and Senate guards pursuing someone down Parliaments marble-lined Hall of Honor toward the Library of Parliament, a separate building attached at the rear. Repeated shooting can be heard on its audio.In the Conservative caucus room, which exits into the Hall of Honor, members of Parliament piled their large leather chairs against the door as a barricade.Chrystia Freeland, a Liberal member of Parliament, said by phone that she had heard shots as she was heading to her caucus. Ms. Freeland said she had been among many lawmakers rushed to secure basement rooms when there seemed no way for them to leave the building. Im surrounded by more than a dozen House of Commons security guards, she said.Julie Van Dusen, a parliamentary reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, described a scene of confusion. Unable to leave the building, she pounded on office doors, she told a local CBC Radio show, and the staff of a cabinet minister recognized her voice and let her in. They piled furniture against the door and lay on the floor as silently as possible for nearly five hours until heavily armed police officers arrived and took them to a secure part of the building.Mr. Harper was whisked away in his motorcade.There was no official account of how the gunman was shot. But Craig Scott, a member of Parliament, credited 58-year-old Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms and a man better known for carrying a ceremonial mace, with shooting the gunman just outside the party caucus rooms. In a Twitter posting, Mr. Scott said he and his colleagues owe their safety, even lives, to Mr. Vickers.As the police locked down buildings and asked stores to close, an eerie still, broken only by screaming emergency sirens, descended on the district. Long after the drama on Parliament Hill seemed to be settled, groups of heavily armed officers ran through portions of downtown, checking out buildings. Some warned the few people on the streets, mainly journalists, that snipers were a possibility.As thousands of workers were trapped in office towers and shops, gridlock developed as convoys carrying heavily armed officers poured into the area. A large ambulance, designed for a disaster like an airplane crash, set up operation.The easy access to the grounds of Parliament Hill reflected the general Canadian view that an attack was unlikely. Mr. Harper and other members of his cabinet, however, have frequently warned that terrorist attacks might come to Canada.On Twitter, followers of the Islamic State praised the attack  and warned of more to follow.In an audio message last month, the Islamic States spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, exhorted sympathizers to carry out revenge killings and included Canadians on the list of target nationalities.If you can kill a disbelieving American or European  especially the spiteful and filthy French  or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way, however it may be, Mr. Adnani said.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-11-04T00:20:30Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/23/world/23canada6/23canada6-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 4879}, {"title": "Ottawa shootings: Canadians ponder a new 'normal'", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29749485", "text": "The day after a gunman killed a soldier in Ottawa and went on a rampage through Canada's parliament, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher finds out how people in the city are reacting.Wednesday is the day that people do yoga on Parliament Hill.That image sums up how many Canadians see themselves - internationally, a peaceful, neutral nation; at home, a quiet place with strict gun laws and citizens exercising just metres from where their elected leaders run the country.So the violence of this particular Wednesday was a shock.The first reaction was a sort of small-town-like outpouring of solidarity, an emotional session of parliament, and a flood of supportive tweets and messages from Canadians who momentarily put aside their usual political gripes.Behind that though are questions about whether the country is being targeted for participating in the US-led campaign against Islamic State militants - there was an earlier attack on a soldier this week near Montreal - or whether these are isolated incidents.People are asking whether any of this will change Canada's easy-going nature.Some in the Twitter-sphere seemed to think a Rubicon had been crossed.'Back to work this morning, back to normal never,' tweeted @LindaB0118.In Quebec, military personnel were advised not to wear their uniforms in public unless on official duty, although it's not clear if that directive extends across the country.And this morning people hurrying to work said they expected to see more security guards on Parliament Hill, and tighter access restrictions.'Certainly they are going to harden up this perimeter,' said architect Peter Dolan, who spent yesterday in lockdown across the street from the main parliament building.'We've kept it open here quite consciously, we're aware of the risks and the dangers, but the value of democracy and openness is much more important.'The value of democracy was also uppermost in the mind of Liberal MP Wayne Easter when it came to enhancing police powers of surveillance and detention.'You can't legislate out of fear,' he said, referring to a pledge by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to speed up an existing plan to give Canada's spy agency more monitoring muscle.'You've got to legislate wisely,' Mr Easter added. 'And there has to be a balance between national security and public safety and that's always one of the dilemmas.'There seemed to be more unease than outright fear - a sense that Canada couldn't remain completely immune to terrorist attacks, an acknowledgement that not all of its previous overseas adventures had been peacekeeping.'We've been involved in Afghanistan and international operations in the past so I don't think this is any change from that,' said Nigel Thalakada, a policy analyst with the government.'It's disrupted a sense of normalcy but I don't really see an over-reaction to these events, I think people will take it in their stride.'Anecdotally, there seemed to be a general feeling that whatever the immediate reaction, the calm sensibility at the heart of the Canadian character would prevail.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:54:50Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78490000/jpg/_78490626_ottawa3.jpg", "id": 3241}, {"title": "Officials: ISIS forces launch multiple attacks in Iraq", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/20/world/meast/isis-airstrikes/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- ISIS militants launched about 15 near-simultaneous attacks on Kurdish forces in northern Iraq on Monday in what Kurdish government officials and the Kurdish news agency Rudaw said was a fierce and renewed push for Kurdish-held territory.The deadliest of the attacks targeted Mosul Dam, a hugely important location.First, an ISIS-commandeered military truck loaded with explosives targeted a Peshmerga checkpoint along the security belt circling the dam, killing six Peshmerga security forces and injuring seven others critically, according to Peshmerga forces spokesman Said Mamazeen.At almost the same time, ISIS militants launched an attack on the Nineveh Valley near the dam, which was repelled by Peshmerga forces using European and American weapons, the spokesman said.Another Kurdish military official, who asked not to be named for protocol and security reasons, said that despite the attacks, it would be difficult for ISIS to gain control of the dam because of the large numbers of Peshmerga forces in the area.A senior official at the Ministry of Peshmerga, who similarly asked not to be identified as a matter of government protocol, reported that ISIS fighters were also killed in the attacks, and that the Peshmerga successfully repelled most of the more than dozen incidents Monday.Still under siege despite gains against ISIS, fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobani are getting more help, in addition to U.S. airstrikes.U.S. military cargo planes dropped in much-needed weapons, ammunition and medical gear in the dead of night Sunday.And on Monday, Turkey's foreign minister announced his country would let Kurdish Peshmerga from Iraq use Turkish territory to enter Syria and reinforce fighters in Kobani.The help is desperately needed, Kobani officials say. Even though defenders control some 70% of the city, Kobani is cut off and ISIS forces continue to shell it with mortars from the east and south, said Anwar Muslim, a local government official in Kobani.'We always need more water and food, we are essentially under siege,' he said.Tens of thousands of civilians have fled to Turkey as a result of weeks of intense fighting between Syrian Kurdish forces and the Free Syrian Army for control of Kobani, a border town that's one of the last in the region to resist falling to ISIS.The city appeared to be close to falling before U.S. and allied airstrikes helped drive back ISIS forces.Still, the city remains cut off from the ground. The Turkish decision to allow Iraqi Peshmerga to enter Syria through its territory could provide an influx of much-needed ground forces to help.But no Peshmerga have yet arrived in Kobani to aid in the city's defense, Muslim said Monday.'There has not been any communication with (the Iraqi Kurds) on this, with us inside,' Muslim said. 'We will announce it when and if they come.'On Monday, a fighter inside Kobani said two car bombers detonated their explosives in the city's eastern industrial area. One killed two Syrian Kurdish fighters, and the other was shot at by Kurdish forces and detonated explosives before reaching intended targets, said the fighter, who can't be named for security reasons.ISIS also launched a new attack from the east at the Mursitpinar border crossing with Turkey on Monday night, hitting it with at least a dozen mortar shells in an hour, the fighter said.The fighter also reported three daytime airstrikes Monday in the city's industrial section.At least 21 killed in Baghdad suicide bombingSunday's airdrop in Kobani was delivered by three C-130 cargo planes and appeared to have been received on the ground by Kurdish fighters, senior Obama administration officials said.A fighter on the ground in Kobani who cannot be identified for security reasons saw more than 100 large crates, including a crate with M-16 guns. A doctor in Kobani said he had received a ton of crucial medical supplies, including antibiotics and other materials.President Barack Obama notified Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of the drop in a phone conversation Saturday night, administration officials said.'We have made clear to the Turkish government for some days now the urgency of facilitating resupply to those forces,' one official said.Erdogan was quoted in the Turkish media as saying it would be inappropriate for the United States to arm Kurdish militants in Kobani whom he considers terrorists.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, however, said that Turkish officials had evaluated 'the United States' airdrop of military and medical aid that was provided by our Iraqi Kurdish brothers to Kobani and all the forces that are defending Kobani within this framework. And we are helping Peshmerga forces to cross into Kobani for support. Talks on this are continuing.'But he said Turkey is not ready to back fully the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, known by its Kurdish acronym PYD.Cavusoglu equated the PYD with ISIS, saying both aim to control Syrian territory, which Turkey and the Free Syrian Army both oppose.'We think it (the PYD) is a threat to Syria's future, territorial integrity and democratic structure, and as long as the PYD continues with these goals, it cannot get the support of the Free Syrian Army or Turkey,' Cavusoglu said.The airdrop was partly humanitarian but also aimed at shoring up the Kurdish defenders of Kobani, senior Obama administration officials said, acknowledging it was a shift in the administration's tactics.'This is a part of the President's larger strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL wherever they are,' one official said, using the term favored by the administration and some other nations in referring to ISIS, which also calls itself the 'Islamic State.'The United States has generally downplayed the importance of Kobani as a key city in the battle against the militants.However, if ISIS takes Kobani, it would mean the group would control land between the northern Syrian city of Raqqa and Turkey -- about 100 kilometers (60 miles) apart.The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria took control of Raqqa last year. ISIS uses the once liberal city as a kind of headquarters where it applies its hard-line interpretation of Islamic law, terrorizing the population.With the help of airstrikes from an international coalition led by the United States, Kurdish and Iraqi forces are now focused on pushing ISIS back from its relentless attempt to take Kobani.At least 70 ISIS bodies dropped off at Syrian hospitalThe strategy against ISIS is working, Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of U.S. Central Command, said last week.U.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in Kobani, Central Command said, both times targeting ISIS fighting positions. That's far fewer strikes than days before. U.S. jets flew at least 14 missions near the city Thursday and Friday, the military reported.It will take 'strategic patience' to beat ISIS, Austin said.ISIS has apparently taken a heavy hit over the past several days. The bodies of at least 70 fighters for the terror group have been dropped off over four days at a hospital in the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, a Syrian opposition group told CNN. Tal Abyad is on the Turkish border and about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Raqqa.It's unclear who dropped the bodies of the ISIS fighters off at the hospital, but it was probably other fighters from the militant group, because they control Tal Abyad.CNN's Kareem Khadder, Anna-Maja Rappard, Laura Koran, Ashley Fantz, Raja Razek and journalist Zeynep Bilginsoy contributed to this report.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T22:07:26Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141020151447-explosion-in-kobani-story-top.jpg", "id": 2034}, {"title": "Ancient Babylon 'under threat' from Islamic State", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29754196", "text": "There are fears that the ancient site of Babylon in present-day Iraq is threatened with destruction by the militant group calling itself Islamic State.Across Syria and Iraq, priceless historical relics have already been destroyed or sold by the militants to buy weapons.And monuments and buildings, some more than 1,000 years old, have been blown up, as they have been regarded by extremists as un-Islamic.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T03:43:39Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3324}, {"title": "Longtime U.S. diplomat under federal counterintelligence probe  Erin Burnett OutFront", "url": "http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2014/11/07/longtime-u-s-diplomat-under-federal-counterintelligence-probe/", "text": "(CNN) - FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel in October as part of a counterintelligence investigation, three U.S. government officials told CNN.As part of the investigation, Raphel's State Department office was searched and sealed, two of the officials said.

The area is in the desert heartland of the territory the group has seized for its self-declared caliphate.Both officials said that the strikes had killed many militants from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, including two of its regional governors. Rumors also swirled that the groups leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, had been at the meeting and was either wounded or killed. The officials said they had no confirmed information about Mr. Baghdadis presence at the meeting.A Defense Department official confirmed that coalition aircraft had carried out an air attack against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders, but said the strike had been near Mosul, which is 180 miles from Qaim. The discrepancy in the reported locations could not be immediately explained.The defense official also said there had been no confirmation that Mr. Baghdadi was present at the meeting.If confirmed, the death of high-ranking Islamic State leaders would be a blow to the group and would indicate that the United States and its allies have a means of tracking some of its most important figures.The Iraqi officials said they believed that the dead included the Islamic State ruler, or wali, of Anbar Province, who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Muhannad al-Sweidawi, and the ruler of Deir al-Zour Province in Syria, Abu Zahra al-Mahamdi.Hisham Alhashimi, an Iraqi researcher and an expert on the group, said that he, too, had heard that both men were dead, and that their killings would constitute a new threat to the group.Mr. Alhashimi said that Mr. Sweidawi, like many of the groups top leaders, had served in the Iraqi Army under Saddam Hussein and joined Al Qaeda after Mr. Husseins fall from power. Like Mr. Baghdadi, he had been detained by American forces but later released, Mr. Alhashimi said.The Islamic State did not immediately issue any statement on the strikes.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:20:00Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5594}, {"title": "Shooter: 'It doesn't matter if I killed bin Laden'", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/07/us/bin-laden-shooter-interview/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- The former Navy SEAL who says he fired the shot that killed Osama bin Laden says he doesn't care if people believe him.'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am 'The Shooter.' The team got him,' Robert O'Neill said in an audio interview with freelance journalist Alex Quade, a former CNN correspondent, that aired Friday on CNN's 'AC360.''Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.''AC360' obtained the audio interview from Quade, who conducted a series of interviews with O'Neill over the past 18 months.The killing of bin Laden will go down in history, O'Neill said. 'But I don't care if I'm 'The Shooter,' and there are people who think I'm not. So whatever.'The audio interview follows an interview published this week in The Washington Post, in which O'Neill publicly identified himself as the SEAL who killed the leader of al Qaeda in 2011.The 38-year-old O'Neill had previously revealed details of the mission to Esquire magazine. But he was hesitant to attach his name to the account until his identity was linked to the story on a military blog earlier this week without his consent.O'Neill told the Post that other SEAL team members were involved in the raid, including Matt Bissonnette, who detailed the group's experiences in his memoir, 'No Easy Day,' written under the pseudonym Mark Owen.O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions, but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult.In the audio interview with Quade, he said the members of SEAL Team Six talked about the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. He and other team members believed they would not return alive from the mission to get bin Laden.'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said.'...(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.'He also said when he identified himself as the shooter to the families of 9/11 victims, they thanked him for closure.'He died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure,' he said in the audio interview.O'Neill's move to go public is a controversial one, as it violates an unspoken military rule: Don't seek attention for your service.'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain,' said an October 31 letter to the Naval Special Warfare ranks from commanding officer B.L. Losey and force Master Sgt. M.L. Margaraci.In the audio interview, O'Neill says he believes some details about the bin Laden mission, such as how he was killed, were no longer classified because they had been repeatedly leaked in the aftermath by high-level officials.'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said.'...I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.'Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards. They also wounded two other women.O'Neill has told his story before in a lengthy profile in Esquire in 2013, in which O'Neill was described not with his real name but only as 'The Shooter.'In the Esquire piece, O'Neill/The Shooter was said to have encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad where he had been hiding for more than five years.The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun 'within reach,' and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. That account was in conflict with the narrative in 'No Easy Day.'Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN's Peter Bergen the story of The Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is 'complete BS.'But in the audio interview, O'Neill dismissed the criticism.'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said. '...You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.'CNN's Slma Shelbayah, Peter Bergen, Anderson Cooper, Jack Gray and Charlie Moore contributed to this report.Watch Anderson Cooper 360 weeknights 8pm ET.

A former CNN producer and correspondent, she is the author of 'The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television.' Follow her on Twitter @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely hers.(CNN) -- Apparently it was a coincidence, but the deadly shooting in Ottawa came on the same day that the 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai was scheduled to speak with high school students and receive honorary Canadian citizenship.Instead of listening to Malala, instead of seeing Prime Minister Stephen Harper honor the idealistic teenager who defied radicals to advocate peace, reconciliation, and education, Canadians watched in horror as their normally placid capital became the scene of mayhem in what Harper later described as a terrorist attack.It was the second attack this week, the second in which a Canadian soldier was killed. In both cases the alleged perpetrators were men whose passports authorities had confiscated fearing they had become radicalized and would travel to the Middle East to join Islamist extremists.The Ottawa attack kept Malala from delivering her message in person. And yet, there is something profoundly powerful in this intersection -- in this scheduling conflict of competing ideologies.The killings in Canada and the canceled events delineate a sharp contrast between the alternative worldviews faced by young people today -- particularly by young Muslims.They also highlight the need to develop a clear path of active involvement for those who want to join in making a reality of Malala's vision, just as those who support extremists receive clear direction on how to join their cause.On one side there is the future outlined with such remarkable clarity by Malala, one in which we provide educational opportunities for all, strive for peace, and respect our differences. She has the heavy burden of having become the torch-bearer for advocates of moderation, coexistence and equality.Then there is the other end of the spectrum, inhabited by the hyper-extremist group known as ISIS, which also manages to communicate its vision for the future, broadcasting its ideology, its military exploits and its excesses across social media platforms.Malala had arrived in Toronto this week, as scheduled but, sadly, she left town without speaking, after her events were canceled as a result of the crisis in Ottawa. She tweeted, 'I extend my thoughts and prayers to the Canadian people during this difficult time.'It was not the first time that her plans were abruptly changed by a shooter. Her life took a most unexpected turn in 2012 after an extremist tried to kill her.Now, with the rise of ISIS and a jihadist appeal that has brought young Muslims from around the world to fight in Syria and Iraq, Malala's symbolic place in the battle of ideas extends beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan.Now it is vital that her message be heard everywhere. But she cannot do it alone. There is a great need to build on her ideas with practical action.Those who accept the ISIS creed know what to do. They travel to the Middle East to join their jihad, or they follow ISIS's deadly guidance at home. For those who embrace Malala's enlightened view there is no clear path ahead. How does a young person join the cause of freedom and equality?One of the admirable aspects of young adulthood is an awakening to the larger world; a wish to become involved in something larger than ourselves, a drive to make the world a better place.Consider Malala's words at the U.N. last year: 'We call upon all communities to be tolerant -- to reject prejudice based on cast, creed, sect, religion or gender. To ensure freedom and equality for women so that they can flourish. We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave -- to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential.'Compare it to the ISIS appeal, which a few days ago proclaimed the rightness of its revival of slavery and slave markets for selling Yazidi women, or its more recent call to followers, 'If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.'The jihadi appeal is quickly rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, but the tiny percentage who accept it can cause terrible damage. And their help contributes to ISIS victories in the Middle East that are destroying the lives of men and women, including those who might have grown into future Malalas.Malala's canceled events in Canada will likely be rescheduled. When she returns, she will have a message that will resonate even louder after what occurred in Ottawa. Until then, let her supporters come up with a plan so that those who would follow her can help build the world she envisions, with organizations and active movements in which people can enlist to promote equality, coexistence, and acceptance of other points of view.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:14:35Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141010121544-01-malala-nobel-1010-story-top.jpg", "id": 3434}, {"title": "Death toll grows as Lebanese soldiers, militants battle", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/25/world/meast/lebanon-clashes/index.html", "text": "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Lebanese military forces battled militants in Tripoli on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of two militants and two civilians and injuries to 13 troops, the Lebanese army said.State media and security officials said nine Lebanese soldiers were killed, but army officials couldn't be immediately reached for comment on that report.An officer was also among the those injured in the clashes in the nation's second-largest city, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.The militants are Sunnis who sympathize with ISIS extremists, who have been waging attacks inside neighboring Syria and, beyond that, in parts of Iraq, according to Lebanese media reports.

Yet that is exactly what a Saudi court did on October 15th, when it sentenced to death Nimr Baqir al-Nimr, a prominent Shia cleric. The shock ruling instantly prompted street protests in the largely Shia populated Eastern Province, where most of the kingdoms oil is produced. The move threatens to reignite sectarian violence that has erupted periodically over recent decades, as well as to sour efforts to sooth Sunni-Shia tensions across the wider region. The head of Irans armed forces warned Saudi Arabia that it would pay dearly if the execution were carried out.A powerful orator, 54-year-old Sheikh Nimr emerged as a leader of protests that broke out in 2011 in response to the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in neighbouring Bahrain. The island kingdom, whose predominantly Shia population is ruled by a Sunni dynasty, is linked to the Eastern Province by a causeway. In sermons Mr Nimr did not only denounce the Bahraini clampdown, which was bolstered by troops from Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Gulf allies. He also demanded greater rights for Saudi Arabias own disenfranchised Shias, who have long complained of discrimination in government jobs and education, as well as of being demonised by official media. The first Shia minister in Saudi history was only appointed in June this year.Mr Nimr was careful not to incite violence, telling protesters to use peaceful means only. He also insisted that Sunnis as well as Shias were victims of similar repression, condemning the Iranian-backed regime of Bashar Assad in Syria in the same breath as the ruling Al Khalifa family of Bahrain. But such blanket denunciations of tyranny may be exactly what angered the Saudi authorities. When police arrested Mr Nimr in July, 2012, they claimed, unconvincingly, that the four bullet wounds he received in his leg had been the result of an exchange of gunfire.The Saudis may wager that the harsh sentence is more likely to act as a deterrent than become a cause for continued protest. Much has changed in the two years since Sheikh Nimrs arrest, which had sparked riots leading to the deaths of three protesters. Such is the fear of instability among Saudis that Shia rage has largely fizzled out over the past few months.People point to Bahrain, whose Shias have largely, albeit sullenly, submitted to a heavily policed calm, warily contrasting this with the chaos across the border in Iraq and Syria, where sectarian hatred has added fuel to bloody civil wars. With the Saudi air force engaged in war, alongside the American-led coalition, against the Sunni fanatics of IS, Saudi Shia may confine their unhappiness for the time being to comments on Facebook.Another calming factor, says Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, a human-rights activist in the eastern city of Dammam, is that the death sentence is unlikely to be carried out. Saudi Arabia tends to reserve actual executions for criminals or the likes of al-Qaeda militants who staged a bombing campaign in 2003-06. Sheikh Nimr will appeal against his sentence; and King Abdullah, who likes to be seen as the benevolent patriarch, could yet pardon him. That said, the Saudis are hardly shy of the death penalty. Last year the kingdom executed (usually by beheading) more people than any other country bar China, Iran and Iraq.", "source": "http://www.economist.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T00:04:05Z", "top_image": "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/5605/teg.tdqk/djek/a&t=subs%3Dn%26wsub%3Dn%26sdn%3Dn%26!c%3D21625868%26pos%3Dmpu_bottom&sz=300x250|50x50|300x600&tile=9&c=201356527", "id": 1917}, {"title": "U.S. opens channels with Iran over ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/06/politics/obama-iran-isis-letter/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's administration is trying to open channels of communication with Iran regarding the war on ISIS.Amid revelations that Obama sent a letter to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last month pointing out the countries' shared interest in beating ISIS, a senior U.S. official and a Western diplomat tell CNN that Washington has gone through the Iraqis to communicate with Iran.The conversations do not include taking joint military action against ISIS targets, the sources said, but are seen as necessary to avert conflict in U.S. and Iranian operations.Senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer wouldn't address specific outreach efforts in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, but said: 'We work very closely with the Iraqis and the Iraqis have a relationship with the Iranians.'The discussions through the Iraqis are informal and conducted on a case-by-case basis via the Iraqi military, the sources said. The channels have become necessary, the U.S. military official said, because the United States and Iran are now operating in the same spaces. As a result, 'accommodations must be made indirectly,' this official said. This includes airspace management, so U.S. and Iranian forces do not conflict while carrying out military operations in the same airspace, CNN was told.The revelation of the communications channel comes even as the military and administration continue to insist it is not cooperating with the Iranians on strategy or intelligence.'With respect to Iran, we're not coordinating with Iran, as you know,' said Gen. Lloyd Austin, the head of U.S. Central Command, at an event moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday, when asked how the United States prevents any accidental killing of Iranians who are on the ground advising Iraqi forces.The White House also stressed it is not working alongside the Iranian military.'The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran in that effort. We won't share intelligence with them,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday when asked about another communication between President Obama and Iran's Supreme Leader.Earnest would not acknowledge Obama's letter, saying he would not talk about the 'private correspondence' of the President.'I can tell you that the policy that the President and his administration have articulated about Iran remains unchanged. The United States is engaged in conversations with Iran in the context of the P-5-plus-1 talks to resolve the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,' Earnest said. 'We have also discussed on the sidelines of those talks on at least a couple of occasions, the ongoing campaign that is being conducted against ISIL by the United States and 60 members of -- now more than 60 -- members who are part of this broader coalition.'Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham blasted the Obama administration, saying it's 'outrageous' to reach out to the 'same Iranian regime that has been complicit in the rise of ISIS by pushing a violent sectarian agenda throughout the Middle East.''The administration needs to understand that this Iranian regime cares more about trying to weaken America and push us out of the Middle East than cooperating with us,' McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. 'Until we recognize that reality, and formulate a regional strategy to counter the Iranian regime's malign influence, we will continue to harm U.S. national security interests, as well as our relationships with our closest regional allies and partners, in pursuit of the illusory goal of rapprochement with the current Iranian leadership. The consequences of this ill-conceived bargain would destroy the Syrians' last best chance to live in freedom from the brutal Assad regime.'State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S.-Iran nuclear talks aren't linked to U.S. cooperation with Iran in combating ISIS.'We don't look at it as a linked situation,' she said. 'Our concerns about Iran's engagement are more expansive than that. Obviously, we understand that they have concerns about the threat of ISIL, which they have expressed as well, but I would not look at it as a path to a different type of coordination.'While the United States acknowledged notifying Iran before striking in Syria earlier this year, administration officials have said there is no cooperation between the countries in combating ISIS. Secretary of State John Kerry said there would be no 'cooperation,' but the United States wanted to 'de-conflict.''The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran in that effort. We won't share intelligence with them. But their interests in the outcome is something that's been widely commented on -- commented upon and something that on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations,' Earnest said.Central Command general to ISIS: We can hear youWhile there are many other concerning aspects of Iranian behavior for the United States, including human rights and Americans in captivity, the nuclear deal is seen as the major impediment, one of the sources said.The administration did not notify its Mideast allies in Israel or the Gulf about the letter, the other source said.In September, Khamenei said he rejected U.S. overtures to join the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS.Report: Children say ISIS captured, beat them on way home from examsIn comments released by Iran's FARS news agency, Khamenei detailed what he called 'U.S. demands for cooperation.''During the hard days of Daesh's attacks on Iraq, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq demanded our envoy in the country (Iraq) that Iran and the U.S. meet for negotiations and coordination on Daesh,' Khamenei said, using a derogatory nickname for ISIS. 'Our ambassador reflected the issue to Iran and although some officials didn't voice opposition, I opposed it and said we will not cooperate with the Americans in this regard since they have a corrupt intention and stained hands and how could we have cooperation with the Americans under such conditions?'Referring to Kerry's comments that Iran would not be invited to join the anti-ISIS coalition, Khamenei said, according to FARS, 'The same U.S. secretary of state had personally demanded (Iranian Foreign Minister) Dr. (Mohammad Javad) Zarif, and called for cooperation with us on Daesh but Dr. Zarif had rejected his demand.' He added that Acting Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator in the nuclear talks, 'repeated the same demand for cooperation with Iran' with her counterparts.Opinion: Why West must roll back military involvement in Iraq, SyriaObama has made at least two other overtures to the Supreme Leader since taking office in 2009.News of the letter angered congressional opponents of a nuclear deal with Iran. They are already deeply discomforted by details of a possible agreement that have been emerging ahead of an end-of-November deadline.One senior GOP congressional staffer told CNN's Stephen Collinson that the letter was sending 'shock waves' through Capitol Hill and suggested it would also anger Israel and U.S. allies in the Middle East who think the President is already going behind their backs to negotiate a 'bad deal' with Iran.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:45:41Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131121161623-khamenei-story-top.jpg", "id": 6096}, {"title": "Why we must talk to the bad guys -- even ISIS", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/10/15/opinion/powell-isis/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Jonathan Powell was Chief of Staff for British Prime Minister Tony Blair and is now head of the charity Inter-Mediate. His book 'Talking to Terrorists How to End Armed Conflicts' is published by Bodley Head. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.London (CNN) -- When people watch the cold-blooded beheading of a western journalist on TV they react emotionally. They want revenge. So do I. But I have come to understand that is not the best way to go about tackling terrorist groups. History suggests you need a coolly thought-out strategy if you want to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' ISIS as U.S. President Barack Obama put it, rather than a knee-jerk reaction.Colin Parry's 12-year-old son Tim died in his arms after being blown up by an IRA bomb in the northern English town of Warrington in 1993. Last week at Cheltenham Literary Festival Parry said that if he had known that Prime Minister John Major had been corresponding with the IRA when that bomb went off he would have been horrified. But if you had asked him six months later he said he would have welcomed Major's attempt to end the conflict through talking.READ: ISIS states its justification for the enslavement of womenIf even victims can see the wisdom of talking to terrorists why can't policy makers? I have been accused of being naive for even suggesting the idea. But it is not an idea I have pulled out of thin air -- a study of conflicts over the last 30 years shows that governments when confronted by a new terrorist group invariably say they won't talk to them but nearly always end up doing so from South Africa to El Salvador to Indonesia.This is not to say that talking is an alternative to fighting -- they have to go hand in hand. Nor am I suggesting sitting down with ISIS now to negotiate even if they were prepared to sit down with us. Negotiations can only happen when the conditions are right, usually when a mutually hurting stalemate is in place and both sides realize they cannot win by military means.But people forget how long the process leading up to a successful negotiation can take. The British government opened up a secret channel to the IRA in 1972 and yet the real negotiations only happened in 1991-93 when Major opened his correspondence with Irish republican politician Martin McGuinness. It takes a long time for armed groups to realize that their demands are unachievable and to start to consider what else they would settle for.READ: Who's doing what in the coalition battle against ISISThe same is true of ISIS. No one is going to agree to a universal caliphate. But once ISIS realizes they can't win then they may be prepared to talk and we need to open a secret channel now to give time to establish enough trust to move to negotiations when the moment comes. There are practical things we can talk to them about. The ex-Baathists and ex-Iraqi army offices that make up a major part of the ISIS force have genuine grievances about the way they were treated by the sectarian Maliki government. We can discuss with them ways of ensuring Sunnis have a powerful voice in a Shia majority Iraq.The real problem is that each new terrorist group comes as a surprise to us. The philosopher John Gray considers that the 'obstacle to coping with the terrorist threat is the belief that it is unlike anything in the past.'I suggested in 2008 when I had left government that on the basis of my experience in Northern Ireland we ought to speak to Hamas, the Taliban and al Qaeda. The government spokesman dismissed my comments saying that while Her Majesty's Government might be prepared to talk to the IRA and the PLO, they would never talk to these new groups. In the subsequent six years however the Israeli and U.S. governments have negotiated a cease-fire with Hamas, the U.S. government has negotiated the release of Sergeant Bowe Berghdal with the Taliban and a former Director-General of MI5 has said we should be talking to al Qaeda.If the position can change so quickly on these groups then there is every reason to suppose the same can happen with ISIS.Terrorism is not going to disappear even if we deal with al Qaeda and ISIS. People keep hoping for technological solutions like drones or jungle penetrating radar, but as fast as we develop them the terrorists find a way round them. So we should recognize that we already have the only tools we will ever have for dealing with terrorism and those are fighting and talking. By using only one tool, counter terrorism measures, we are not going to solve the problem unless we think we can kill each and every one of them. What we need to do is to combine security pressure down on the terrorist group with giving them a political way out through talking.Negotiations with terrorists are almost never successful straight away. Eventual success is built on multiple failures as in Northern Ireland and Spain. But all conflicts are capable of resolution. What we need is leaders who believe they can solve the problem and are willing to take the necessary risks to do so. Above all we need to learn from our past mistakes and successes instead of trying to reinvent the wheel very time we meet a new armed group.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-10-15T15:51:16Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140630144426-iraq-isis-checkpoint-story-top.jpg", "id": 963}, {"title": "Neighbors warn South Sudan to end conflict", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/08/world/africa/south-sudan-igad-warning/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Regional leaders on Saturday warned South Sudan's warring rivals to end their months of conflict or risk intervention by neighboring nations to restore peace.President Salva Kiir has been embroiled in a power struggle with his fired deputy, Riek Machar, whom he accused of trying to oust him through a coup last year.Since the attempted coup in December, militia loyal to both have battled each others' forces. Violence has quickly spread, with reports of mass killings nationwide.Talks and repeated pleas for peace have yielded no results.IGAD, a regional African bloc that comprises neighboring nations, has given the two sides 15 days to consult and come up with a resolution.Both sides must talk and produce a plan for an 'unconditional, complete and immediate end' to all violence, it said.Any side that violates the resolution will face region-wide asset freezes, travel bans and an arms embargo, among other sanctions, the regional bloc said in a statement.'The IGAD region shall, without further reference to the warring parties, take the necessary measures to directly intervene in South Sudan to protect life and restore peace and stability,' it said.The conflict has continued unabated for nearly a year, raising fears it may spill into neighboring nations already taking in refugees fleeing the violence.More than 1.5 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations, and thousands more killed. Some civilians have fled to U.N. bases in the country, making the facilities targets for armed militants.South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.Since the split, the nation has battled various setbacks, prompting IGAD nations, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda, to seek mediation. The violence is divided along tribal lines -- the Nuer community backs rebel leader Machar while the President is a Dinka.This would not be the first deal between the warring parties.

But he said the coalition of nations allied against the militants should understand that this is going to be a long-term campaign.The president offered his cautionary message even as his strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy the Islamic State with an air campaign is coming under increasing attack from critics who say the United States and its coalition partners are losing ground against the enemy.In Syria, the militants continued to make gains in their battle for the town of Kobani, on the border with Turkey, despite a barrage of airstrikes from American and Saudi warplanes on Monday and Tuesday. In Iraq, Islamic State fighters have seized vast parts of Anbar Province and have pushed within about 15 miles of Baghdad.Iraqi Army forces withdrew on Monday from a base near the town of Hit, in Anbar, after an advance by Islamic State fighters. The retreat by the Iraqi Army raised new questions about Mr. Obamas hopes for an air campaign that would support local ground forces.In a briefing with reporters, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, defended the presidents approach in the region, saying that there are specific episodes in recent months that serve as evidence that the presidents strategy against the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS or ISIL, is working.But like the president, Mr. Earnest also suggested that success will not be quick or easy in the region, and he urged patience in judging the effort.I dont think anybody has sought to leave you or anyone else with the impression that these kinds of airstrikes were going to dramatically reverse the situation on the battlefield overnight, Mr. Earnest told reporters. They wont.Mr. Earnest also played down concerns about Turkish airstrikes against Kurdish insurgent positions in southeastern Turkey on Monday. Mr. Earnest said that the United States government continued to have conversations with Turkeys political and military leaders about its role in the fight against the Islamic State. He said a team of American military specialists was in Turkey to continue those talks.Not only will we continue to be in touch with them on operationalizing the commitments theyve already made but also having ongoing discussions with them about additional commitments they could make to support this broad international coalition, Mr. Earnest said.The presidents talk with the foreign military commanders provided a rare venue for Mr. Obama, who usually reserves his public time for meetings with the political leadership of the countries he has persuaded to be part of the military coalition in the region.United States military officials invited their counterparts to what White House aides described as a two-day seminar at the secure Air Force base in Maryland that is better known as the home base of the presidents plane.In addition to the foreign military officers, most of the presidents senior national security advisers also attended. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel did not attend because they were traveling, officials said.In his brief remarks, Mr. Obama described the fight against the militants in Iraq and Syria as an ideological battle that would need to include economic development for the countries involved and the communication of an alternative vision to those who would otherwise be attracted to fight for the Islamic State.The all-day gathering began with remarks from Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Lloyd Austin, the head of the militarys Central Command, which is overseeing the armed campaign against the Islamic State.After intelligence and operations briefings from American officers, the participants engaged in a series of discussions, including an assessment of the threat that the Islamic State poses and how the flow of thousands of fighters from around the world has fueled the strife in Syria and Iraq, according to one participant.The uniformed officers who participated were from Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Netherlands, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-10-15T20:00:02Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/15/world/PREXY/PREXY-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 994}, {"title": "The case of Tripoli's disappearing bronze nude", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/africa/libya-gazelle-statue/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Residents of Tripoli woke up Tuesday to find that a landmark statue of a naked woman stroking a gazelle had mysteriously disappeared from the center of the Libyan capital.No one has so far claimed responsibility for removing the statue but residents and journalists suspect hardline Islamist militants who have in the past branded the nude artwork immoral and called for its removal.The bronze statue dates back to the Italian colonial era and, until Tuesday, sat in a fountain at the eponymous Gazelle Roundabout in central Tripoli near the Mediterranean.'All that remains is part of the base, showing that the bronze statue was wrenched off its pedestal, probably by a mechanical digger,' reported the English-language daily Libya Herald.The Culture Ministry condemned the act, saying in a statement 'the stealing of the statue is an act of vandalism and is an attempt to obliterate the trace and history of Libya's landmarks.'The Tripoli local council also issued a condemnation and called on fellow Libyans to 'protect Libyan heritage and monuments in their area.'The statue was hit by a mortar shell during heavy clashes between rival militias in August, leaving a gaping hole in the woman's side.Its removal is the latest example of friction between the powerful Islamist groups and more liberal elements of Libyan society.A video on Libyan television from February 2012 shows a small group of intellectuals and journalists holding a demonstration at the roundabout following hardline Islamists' threats to remove the statue.One image appears to show a cut in gazelle's leg, indicating an attempt to saw through the statue. Around that same time, the statue was temporarily covered up by a blue plastic tarp to hide her nudity.There was plenty of condemnation on social media, but at least one poster on Twitter who sympathizes with the ISIS terror group saw the removal as a good thing.'Statue of Italians who brutally killed Libyans for over 20+ years is brought down today in '#Tripoli. Libya is free,' tweeted the user who only goes by the name 'Islam,' later posting: 'Any Libyan who like that statue hates Libya and Islam.'Libya has been in the throes of civil unrest since the 2011 revolution and ouster of dictator Moammar Gadhafi, with rival militant factions competing for control over political and economic power and Libya's vast oil reserves.There are even two rival governments -- an Islamist-backed, self-installed government controls Tripoli, while a Western-backed government elected in June operates out of the country's east.There have been fierce deadly clashes for weeks in Benghazi after the Western-backed government and forces loyal it launched a military operation to drive out Islamist militias from the city.Read: Vandewalle: Libya is in a state of civil war", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:43:04Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141105121624-libya-removed-statue-story-top.jpg", "id": 6061}, {"title": "As Qaeda-Backed Group Makes Gains, Rift Grows Among Rebels in Syria", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/world/middleeast/nusra-front-gains-in-syria.html", "text": "BAGHDAD  The Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group affiliated with Al Qaeda, has been expanding its control in the northern province of Idlib, seizing territory from two Western-supported rebel organizations and potentially threatening a critical border crossing with Turkey, according to rebels and monitoring groups.Groups in Idlib have been a focus of the Obama administrations plan to train and equip some Syrian rebels to fight Islamic State, the jihadist group that has occupied territory further east in Syria and Iraq. And though the province represents just a small part of the sprawling conflict in Syria, it has been an important center of international attempts to organize and supply the resistance to President Bashar al-Assads government.Two groups that the Nusra Front has seized bases from in recent days, the Syrian Revolutionaries Front and the Hazm Movement, are considered moderates and have received limited arms support from the West. Despite that, they have been unable to hold their ground against the extremists in this latest outbreak of rebel infighting, commanders say.The trouble began last week when the Nusra Front began moving against the Syrian Revolutionaries Front, headed by Jamal Maarouf, a former construction worker-turned rebel leader who has been widely accused by other rebels of war profiteering.As the Nusra Front pushed him and his fighters from the area, Mr. Maarouf spoke out in videos posted online. In one, he walked over rocky ground, saying his men were defending Syria. After the Nusra Front took over his home village, Deir Sunbul, last week, he acknowledged in another video that he had fled and vowed to come back and liberate the area, village by village.Activists linked to the Nusra Front struck back, posting videos of their fighters gathering weapons from Mr. Maaroufs storehouses and of more than a dozen decomposed bodies of people they accused Mr. Maaroufs men of killing and dumping in a well.Rami Abdul-Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said he considered the videos genuine. His group, which tracks the conflict from Britain through contacts on the ground, reported earlier this year that Mr. Maaroufs fighters had executed more than 90 Islamist rivals and dumped them in wells.These are some of those bodies, Mr. Abdul Rahman said.Mr. Maarouf could not be reached for comment on the bodies.It remains unclear how much support Mr. Maaroufs group had received from the West, and some say the West does not give him aid. But the other affected group, the Hazm Movement, has been a key recipient of military aid from a covert program run by the United States and other countries from across the border in Turkey. According to members of the group, this aid has included salaries, light ammunition and a limited number of anti-tank missiles.Activists in Idlib Province said that tensions there had intensified when the Nusra Front chased off Mr. Maarouf. Both groups have fighters from the village of Khan al-Subul, where the Hazm base is, so they sought a deal to avoid bloodshed, with the Hazm fighters withdrawing over the weekend.Activist reports conflicted on what arms the Nusra Front had seized from the base, with some saying they included anti-tank missiles sent by the West and others denying it. Other activists said that dozens of fighters had switched sides, joining the Nusra Front.In an audio interview released online on Tuesday, the head of the Nusra Front, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, attacked Mr. Maarouf, saying his group contained thieves and bandits and that other rebel groups had urged the Nusra Front to oust him.While Mr. Jolani did not mention the Hazm Movement, he criticized Western aid for the rebels, saying it represented an effort to kill the mujahedeen and impose Western policy. After years of refraining from intervening in Syrias civil war, the Obama administration recently announced plans to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State. But that program, meant to train 5,000 fighters a year at a base in Saudi Arabia, has yet to begin, and many in Syrias opposition have criticized the plan, saying their priority is to fight Mr. Assad.Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that American policy toward the so-called moderate rebels had put them in a hard position. Some had aligned with the West in hopes that it would give them arms to fight Mr. Assad, he said. But now the United States wants to use them only to fight the Islamic State, damaging their credibility among Syrians who see Mr. Assad as the greater enemy.This is the worst of all worlds, Mr. Hokayem said. These guys get blamed for being American lackeys even when they get nothing.The infighting has angered residents of rebel-held areas, many of whom accuse rebel leaders of looking out only for themselves.In a video posted this weekend, an unnamed man held up pieces of munitions dropped by Mr. Assads army and accused Mr. Maarouf, the Nusra Front and other rebel factions of doing little to protect civilians.We Sunni Muslims, why cant we unify? the man said. Because we have people with big heads: Me!

Lloyd Austin described as 'legions' of fighters into the city, ISIS commanders have given allied warplanes numerous targets to attack.'The more I attrit him there,' Austin said of ISIS, using a common military term for grinding down an enemy's power, 'the less I'll have to fight him on some other part of the battlefield.'The U.S. military carried out seven airstrikes in northern Syria and coalition aircraft carried out two more near Baiji, north of Tikrit in Iraq, the U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said on Friday. Six of the airstrikes occurred near Kobani, hitting and destroying ISIS buildings, positions, and vehicles, Centcom said.The seventh strike in Syria successfully struck an ISIS-controlled oil installation near Shadadi, a city between the provinces of Deir Ezzor and al-Hasaka in northeastern Syria, according to Centcom.U.S. fighter jets also flew at least 14 missions against ISIS targets near Kobani on Wednesday and Thursday, striking buildings, command posts, sniper positions and a staging location, according to Centcom.CNN has learned that the U.S. military for the first time is getting intelligence from Syrian Kurds about ISIS positions in and around Kobani, according to an administration official who confirmed the details, but declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information.This flow of intelligence for the last several days has led to increased and more precise airstrikes, according to the official.The strikes brought the number of missions flown against targets in the city to 129, by CNN's calculation, the most of any town in the three-week-old Syrian portion of the fight against ISIS.Austin said Friday that the increased number of airstrikes near Kobani aren't due to a change in attitudes, but rather the presence of so many ISIS targets as the group fights Syrian Kurdish fighters for control of the city.Despite apparent advances in recent days by Syrian Kurdish fighters defending Kobani, Austin warned that the city may yet fall.But he said recent successes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq are encouraging signs that the broad coalition effort to ultimately destroy the extremist group is beginning to bear fruit.'The campaign is on the right track. We're doing the right things, and we're having the -- creating the right effects,' he said.U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that it is not essential to keep Kobani from falling into ISIS hands.But retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN on Friday that with the eyes of the world on the fight, Kobani holds psychological and public relations value that 'far outweighs the military victory to whichever side that wins.'The intelligence sharing between U.S. and Syrian Kurds in Kobani signifies an unprecedented level of U.S. military cooperation with operatives on the ground inside Syria.The intelligence operation is extremely sensitive and involves only a small number of Kurds, according to the administration official.Those involved are passing intelligence through their own contacts in Syria and Iraq, and then the information is handed over to U.S. military personnel in Irbil, Iraq, who are working on selecting targets for airstrikes, the administration official said.A number of recent airstrikes in and around Kobani have been highly precise. The Kurds are now able to pass information about the locations of ISIS fighters in the town, the administration official said.The Pentagon has declined to openly discuss the intelligence operation with the Syrian Kurds, and Austin did not address the issue at his briefing Friday.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T04:02:27Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141016115255-isis-kobani-1016-story-top.jpg", "id": 1628}, {"title": "ISIS' magazine: What it tells us (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/20/opinion/bergen-schneider-isis-magazine/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of 'Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad.' Emily Schneider is a research associate at New America.(CNN) -- ISIS is looking to take over a good chunk of the Middle East -- if not the entire Muslim world. At least, that's the message the terrorist movement is sending in its English online magazine, Dabiq.In Dabiq's first issue, which debuted in early July, the magazine declared that a 'new era has arrived' for Muslims. Photographs in the webzine of ISIS militants in American armored vehicles rolling through Iraq seemed to buttress that claim.Graphic photos of dead soldiers from Iraqi forces litter the pages of each of the issues of Dabiq, and articles detail skirmishes across Iraq and Syria.Each issue of the magazine -- there have been four so far, appearing at roughly monthly intervals -- starts with a foreword that contains an inspirational message for readers, before diving into longer pieces that extol the virtues of ISIS and provide updates on the group's military campaign. ISIS members fervently believe that they have established a true 'caliphate' in the areas that they control, a supposed distant echo of the perfect Islamic rule of the Prophet Mohammed and his immediate successors in the seventh century.Overall, the magazine is quite religious in tone. Excerpts from rulings by Muslim scholars are included in every issue, as are religious rationales for the actions of ISIS.In the most recent issue, an ISIS writer reasoned that capturing women from the Yazidis, an Iraqi minority group, to use as sex slaves was acceptable under ISIS' version of Sharia law, since the Yazidis are polytheists, a great heresy in Islam. Showing some convoluted logic, the ISIS writer also asserted that enslaving Yazidi women is a good way to stop adultery, since a man having sex with a concubine is legal under ISIS' interpretation of Islamic law, but sexual relations outside of marriage with free women are forbidden.The magazines are also, unsurprisingly, highly sectarian, repeatedly showing images of Shia shrines and tombs that have been blown up by ISIS, a organization made up of members of the Sunni sect. ISIS believes these sites to be idolatrous. Iraqi Army soldiers -- who are generally Shia -- are referred to as 'apostates' and graphic photos of their executions by ISIS fighters are a staple of the magazine.Other articles aim to reassure readers that ISIS, which in June renamed itself the Islamic State, is an actual state that provides social services and reconstructs critical infrastructure. The magazine asserts that administrators govern towns after the main ISIS fighting force moves on and the most recent issue of Dabiq includes photos with captions showing 'services for Muslims,' including street cleaning, electricity repairs, care homes for the elderly and cancer treatment centers for children.The first issue of Dabiq even had a sort of classified ad for 'all Muslim doctors, engineers, scholars, and specialists' to come and join ISIS.The most recent installment of Dabiq asserts that two new wilayat, or provinces, had been established in the region where the Syrian-Iraqi border had once been. The magazine describes the new provinces as a successful step in 'eliminating any remaining traces of the kufri, nationalistic borders.' Pictures of a military parade celebrating the announcement accompany the article, along with pictures of a well-staffed checkpoint, a bustling marketplace, and ISIS police patrolling the area.In many ways Dabiq is not a new phenomenon. Osama bin Laden's Service Office during the 1980s Afghan war against the Soviets produced a similar magazine, Jihad, which was widely available around the Muslim world, was translated into many languages and was principally a fund-raising and recruiting tool designed to encourage young Muslim men to travel to Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan to support the Afghan jihad.More recently, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula from its headquarters in Yemen has been publishing Inspire, another well-produced online magazine. Inspire, published for the past four years, clearly served as something of a model for Dabiq. Both are well laid out and feature graphics and photos prominently.The Dabiq feature titled 'In the Words of the Enemy,' where a helpful quote from an official or analyst from the West is included, is a direct copy of an Inspire feature. Dabiq's most recent issue features a portion of U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in which he discussed how much of a threat ISIS is to the United States.But the two webzines share few similarities beyond that. Inspire was very much focused on recruiting lone-wolf jihadists and inspiring homegrown extremism in the West, but Dabiq includes only a few vague sentences about carrying out attacks in the West.Where Inspire included instructions on bomb-making and building weapons to carry our attacks in the West, Dabiq focuses almost entirely on the actions of ISIS in Iraq and Syria and encourages followers to join the jihad there. In the third issue of Dabiq an ISIS writer asserts, 'This life of jihad is not possible until you pack and move to the Khilafah,' meaning to leave your home and travel to ISIS' areas of control in Iraq and Syria.The purpose of the Dabiq webzine is quite different from Inspire: It is to encourage and perpetuate ISIS' successful insurgencies in Iraq and Syria, not to foster homegrown extremism or lone-wolf attacks in the West.That's about the only good news that one can glean from Dabiq.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T22:13:41Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141020164443-04-isis-1020-story-top.jpg", "id": 2180}, {"title": "40 arrests in slaying of Pakistani couple", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/asia/pakistan-couple-slain/index.html", "text": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani police say they have arrested up to 40 people in connection with the killing of a Christian couple in Punjab province who were beaten, then pushed into a burning kiln after being accused of desecrating the Quran.Local police officials said a mob from neighboring villages formed Tuesday after a local mullah declared the couple were guilty of blasphemy.The mob allegedly marched to the couple's home, broke down their door, dragged them outside, beat them and threw them into the brick kiln where they both worked.The attack happened in the town of Kot Radha Kishan, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lahore, the capital of Punjab. Police officials identified the woman as Shyman Bibi Urf Shamar, and her husband as Sajjad Nasir Zurjah Nazir Nasir.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), which dispatched a team to the scene, said in a statement that the couple had three young children -- two sons and a daughter, and indicated the slain woman was pregnant.'HRCP is shocked and saddened beyond words by the callous murder of the couple and their unborn child,' the group said.According to the statement, the HRCP team 'did not come across any evidence of desecration of the Holy Quran.'Desecration of the Quran is punishable by death or life imprisonment under Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law.Human rights groups have long urged the country to repeal the law, arguing that it has led to discrimination, persecution and murder.It is often used to settle personal vendettas, rights groups say, and people accused of the committing the crime are frequently targeted by mob violence.That, according to the HRCP, appeared to be the situation in Kot Radha Kishan, and that the incident stemmed with a dispute over money the kiln's owners said the couple owed them.An accusation that the couple had desecrated the Quran 'was spread to nearby villages and announcements [were] made through mosque loudspeakers,' the HRCP said.The mob that went to the kiln was estimated at around 500 people, the rights group said, citing local police.The HRCP said its team learned that four policemen went to the kiln to demand that the couple be handed over for protection from the mob, but that the owners 'instructed their employees not to hand the couple over and the policemen were also beaten up.'The kiln's owners were among those arrested, the rights group said, quoting police.CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Hilary Whiteman wrote from Hong Kong.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:23:29Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141106031812-pkg-ansari-pak-christian-couple-slain-00001904-story-top.jpg", "id": 5663}, {"title": "Friend: Bowe Bergdahl voluntarily left his army base  Erin Burnett OutFront", "url": "http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/14/friend-bowe-bergdahl-voluntarily-left-his-army-base/", "text": "Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, was freed in a prisoner swap after nearly five years in captivity with the Taliban.

He had recently applied for a passport and intended to travel to Syria.At a news conference on Thursday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Bob Paulson described Zehaf-Bibeau as a Canadian-born petty criminal with possible dual citizenship in Libya, where his father was from.Mr Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau was not among the 90 individuals known to Canadian security forces as a 'high-risk traveller', contrary to earlier reports.Nor was he linked to the Muslim convert who on Monday killed a Canadian soldier in Quebec in a hit-and-run attack.'[Zehaf-Bibeau] was an individual who may have held extremist beliefs,' said Mr Paulson, who suggested the passport application process may have driven him to violence.'I think the passport figured prominently in his motives. I'm not inside his head, but I think it was central to what was driving him.'Killed in the Wednesday morning attack was Cpl Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old reservist from Ontario who was standing as an unarmed honour guard, in ceremonial dress, at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Canadian capital's Parliament Hill.According to the RCMP investigation, Zehaf-Bibeau arrived in Ottawa on 2 October, intending to deal with an issue related to his application for a passport.'He was waiting to get it, and there was an investigation going on to determine to see whether he would get a passport,' Mr Paulson said.On Tuesday, he purchased the beige car used in the attack. On Wednesday at about 09:50, he approached the war memorial from behind, fired twice at Cpl Cirillo, who never saw him coming, then fired on the second guard. Cpl Cirillo was struck, but the shot missed the second guard.Zehaf-Bibeau yelled something in English, then drove north on Wellington Street toward Parliament Hill. He stopped his car directly in front of the parliament complex's East Block, and alighted from his vehicle brandishing a rifle as pedestrians fled.Video shows he hijacked a minister's car, then sped off toward Centre Block, by now pursued by police.At Centre Block, he left the stolen car and ran into the building, exchanging gunfire with House of Commons security forces and RCMP officers.He was ultimately shot dead by Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, a former senior RCMP officer, who received a standing ovation in parliament on Thursday.Only one minute and 23 seconds elapsed between the time Zehaf-Bibeau parked his own car and when he entered Center Block.Rows of squad cars blocked the National War Memorial, where a gunman shot and killed a soldier before rampaging through the parliament building.By the standards of most Western cities, these security measures appeared restrained in the wake of a deadly attack.But in a nation where the openness of political institutions is a deeply-cherished article of faith, they were a sign that something was out of the ordinary.Zehaf-Bibeau's assault has shaken a nation already reeling from Monday's attack in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, in which 25-year-old Martin Couture-Rouleau smashed his car into two Canadian soldiers in a car park, killing one.Couture-Rouleau, who authorities say was 'inspired' by Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq and Syria, led police on a brief chase before he wrecked his car, exited the vehicle reportedly brandishing a knife, and was shot dead by the officers.PM Stephen Harper has vowed to strengthen the nation's anti-terrorism laws, and has said Canada will not be intimidated by such violence, nor swayed from its role fighting IS in Iraq alongside the US military.He is now under 24-hour protection, authorities have said.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:50:25Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3100}, {"title": "Why Afghanistan Courts China", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/why-afghanistan-courts-china.html", "text": "WASHINGTON  Last week, Afghanistans new president, Ashraf Ghani, traveled to China for his first state visit abroad. Mr. Ghanis calculation  that Beijing could offset the decline in American and Western support  creates a long-term strategic conundrum: Can Afghanistan attract Chinese investment and security assistance while avoiding the perils of excessive dependency on Beijing?Mr. Ghanis outreach to China is driven by a combination of short-term realities and long-term goals. The Western drawdown comes at a time when the Afghan government is neither fiscally self-sufficient nor capable of defeating the Pakistan-backed Taliban insurgency. In the short term, there is little alternative to international assistance to keep the Afghan state afloat.In the longer term, however, Afghanistan hopes to leverage two of the countrys assets to achieve genuine stability and self-reliance: its natural resources and its strategic location, wedged as it is between Iran, Pakistan, China and the Central Asian states. The development of Afghan infrastructure could turn the country into a regional land bridge. Afghanistan would enjoy unimpeded access to regional and global markets while collecting transit fees from the regions commercial activity.Washingtons long-standing support hasnt been enough to bring the land bridge concept to fruition. Although the United States has spent $4 billion constructing roads, the project requires far more money and political stability. The Asian Development Bank estimates that an additional $2 billion of investments in roads and transmission lines is required  and even more for pipelines, railways and upgrading regional infrastructure. Yet continuing security challenges are diverting attention and resources from the initiative.China is perhaps the only power with the incentives, resources and national will to make Afghanistans ambitious vision a reality. Beijing has already made sizable investments in Afghan copper and oil  including a $3 billion agreement to develop the Aynak copper mine. China is eyeing Afghan natural gas. Western companies, lacking sufficient state backing from their governments, have proven unwilling or unable to make comparable investments. If Beijing were to invest in the countrys infrastructure, new transit corridors would facilitate Chinese trade westward to Iran and the Middle East, and south to the Gwadar port in Pakistan.Despite the fact that an Afghan land bridge would give Pakistan access to Central Asian markets and products, American pressure alone has not persuaded Islamabad to abandon its support for militants. Pakistans civilian leaders are increasingly open to a settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban. But the overall lack of progress on reconciliation is saddling the United States with the disproportionately large cost of supporting Afghanistans security forces.Pakistani intransigence has strengthened Afghanistans case for engagement with China. Since 2001, China has largely stayed on the sidelines as the United States has assumed the heavy lifting on the counterterrorism front. China has pursued its economic interests in Afghanistan while benefiting from the security provided by the American military presence. At the same time, China has maintained friendly relations with Pakistan and has refused to lean on the Pakistani military to change its ways.Recently, however, there have been signs that Chinese policy is changing. Beijing has indicated that it opposes the Talibans return to power and believes that the Talibans participation in the political system should be contingent on its renunciation of violence. China has even offered to mediate discussions between Kabul and the Taliban, a sign that it no longer sees its relations with Afghanistan simply as an extension of its ties to Pakistan. Beijing is also promoting the idea of a regional forum for Afghan reconciliation and favors establishing trilateral meetings between China, Afghanistan and the United States.The Afghan government has so far welcomed Chinese efforts to promote reconciliation. The Talibans reaction, which will be influenced by the outcome of talks between Beijing and Islamabad, remains uncertain. Given that China, unlike America, has earned the Pakistani militarys trust over many decades, Beijing is better positioned to bring about a shift in Pakistani policy.Security interests have been the most important factor in Chinas reassessment. Beijing is belatedly coming to terms with the threat Islamic extremists pose to Chinas territorial integrity. Terrorists in Chinas restive Xinjiang province are training in Pakistani camps and honing military skills through their experience in Afghanistan. China fears that with the American withdrawal, Afghanistan will become a bigger sanctuary for anti-Chinese extremists. The fact that Chinese separatism is becoming a global Islamist cause has not escaped Beijings notice; the Islamic State has already vowed to liberate Xinjiang.Economic and security aid from China is not without risks. Afghan institutions may not be strong enough to ensure that Chinese investors meet their contractual obligation to put Afghans to work, meet international environmental and health standards, and protect heritage sites.And if Americas relations with China deteriorate, Afghanistan might be forced to make a choice. The threat of becoming dependent on China would be particularly acute if the United States were to disengage from Afghanistan. Indeed, during the early years of the Cold War, Afghanistan benefited from the simultaneous infusion of American and Soviet foreign assistance until Washington made a fateful decision to cede the country to Soviet influence.These concerns are not an argument against expanding ties with China. But they underscore the geopolitical factors at play. Afghanistan must ensure that closer ties to China dont come at the expense of its partnership with the West.Washington will have to play its part by participating in the proposed trilateral forum. But it must avoid the temptation to abandon Afghanistan once again and thereby cede wider regional influence to China.Zalmay Khalilzad was the United States ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-11-04T00:12:15Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 4591}, {"title": "Chinas Uighur Unrest Is Opportunity for Afghans", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/world/asia/chinas-uighur-unrest-is-opportunity-for-afghans.html", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan  Since the British first tried and failed to subdue Afghanistan in the 19th century, stumbling into a costly Afghan war seems to have become a mandatory step for global power players. The Soviet Union did it in the 1980s, and the American battle here has passed the 13-year mark.Now, China seems to be taking its turn in coming to grips with Afghanistans role in its national security.No one expects China to be sending troops any time soon, even with the United States and NATO pulling out the last of their combat forces at years end. But China has taken a major step in formalizing closer relations with the Afghan government: Last week, it said it planned to provide billions of dollars in new economic and security assistance.That is being taken as good news by American officials, who have sought to encourage China to take a larger role in Afghanistan beyond just trying to develop the countrys mineral wealth. And Afghan officials, whose economy is in dire shape and whose government is struggling to pay its bills, are eager to find a new source of aid and investment.A major factor in Chinas stepped-up involvement with Afghanistan is a growing alarm in Beijing over Islamist militancy among Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group from northwestern China, analysts say.Since 2001, a smattering of Uighur militants have fought in Afghanistan and elsewhere. And Chinese officials blame a Uighur separatist group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, for a spate of attacks that have killed hundreds of people in China over the past two years.Some experts say Chinese fears that the Uighur separatist cause might spread widely among other militant groups are overblown. But where some see unfounded fears, the Afghans have sensed an opportunity to secure a new, rich benefactor.Further, interviews with Afghan officials suggest that they also hope to use the presence of Uighur militants here to drive a wedge between China and Pakistan, which has aided and sheltered the Taliban in the past and is a longstanding ally of Beijing.In the past year, Afghanistans main intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, has persistently flagged to Beijing each and every one of the dozens of Uighurs who it says were caught by Afghan forces fighting inside the country. And Afghan and Western officials familiar with the effort say that the intelligence agency has painstakingly prepared dossiers for Chinese officials, laying out evidence tracing the militants back to Islamist training camps inside Pakistan.The subject was atop the agenda last month when Rahmatullah Nabil, the acting director of the Afghan intelligence agency, quietly visited Beijing before President Ashraf Ghanis first state trip to China, officials familiar with the negotiations said.Then, after a meeting last week between Mr. Ghani and President Xi Jinping in Beijing, Chinese officials said the two had agreed to jointly press the fight against Uighur militants.In the area of security, President Ghani expressed readiness and staunch support from the Afghan side in Chinas fight against East Turkestan Islamic Movement terrorist forces, Kong Xuanyou, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, told reporters after the meeting, according to Reuters.Mr. Nabil said it was a big achievement that the Chinese government was now listening to the Afghans about Uighurs who were being trained in Pakistan.A big number of Uighurs were arrested, and during the investigation they were talking about where they received training, how they received training, he said in an interview before his most recent visit to China. We think they are preparing themselves, which is a big issue for the Chinese.He added that the new Afghan government was trying to manage the issue, which is precisely what Mr. Ghani appears to have done during his visit to Beijing. There, China pledged nearly $330 million in aid through 2017, a sharp jump from the $250 million it had provided in the past 13 years.China also said it was planning new commercial investments along with an unspecified amount of increased security assistance. Afghan officials say that aid will go far beyond the limited help Beijing had previously provided, much of which focused on counternarcotics efforts.But in doing so, China will also take on bigger risks. So far, the Chinese government has found only trouble with its limited investments in Afghanistan. Its most significant investment to date was a $3 billion concession awarded to the China Metallurgical group to mine a rich vein of copper in an area south of Kabul that is thick with Taliban.That was seven years ago. And in the intervening years, the Chinese have done little to move forward with the project, put off by the threat of Taliban attacks and the general chaos of doing business in Afghanistan. Commitments to build housing for villagers who would be displaced by the mine and to build a railway line and a 400-megawatt power plant have yet to be fulfilled. Afghan officials have in the past year talked of possibly renegotiating the contract.Still, Mr. Ghani unsurprisingly struck a positive note about Chinas newfound willingness to aid Afghanistan upon his return home last weekend.A closer relationship, he told reporters, would help Afghanistan toward becoming an intersection for Asia, as it was during the time of the Silk Road.Yet the importance of the ancient network of routes that connected Europe and Asia began nose-diving around the time the Portuguese mastered the compass, opening sea lanes that could connect the far corners of Europe with the outer reaches of Asia. It quickly became clear that the risk posed by pirates was more manageable than the bandits and unreliable tribes whose main source of wealth was plundering caravans as they lumbered across the mountains and deserts of Central Asia.The camel caravans were long ago replaced by trucks. But the banditry remains, and the raging Taliban insurgency has left stretches of the old Silk Road as dangerous as they have ever been. American projects aimed at creating what officials liked to call a New Silk Road in the past 13 years have yielded little beyond talk and misspent money.Mr. Ghani, in his comments to reporters, acknowledged that peace was needed to ensure any kind of sustained economic development in Afghanistan, be it spurred by Chinese renminbi or American dollars.Asked directly about whether he had asked China to become more involved in putting pressure on the Taliban  and in pressing Pakistan to do more to push the Talibans leadership to negotiate  Mr. Ghani was careful to avoid specifics. Instead, he spoke of the miseries of war and said, We are tired of blood.Then he added, The only one who can be effective in peace is the one who has good relations with all sides.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:05:11Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/06/world/CHINADIPLO/CHINADIPLO-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 5412}, {"title": "Terrorism: First line of defense--Mom and Dad (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/29/opinion/bergen-terror-defense-mom-and-dad/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of 'Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad.' David Sterman is a research associate at New America.(CNN) -- Last week, three teenage girls from Denver were alleged to have tried to join ISIS.The girls were stopped by FBI officials as they transited Frankfurt airport in Germany and were sent back to Colorado.The key lead in this case wasn't high-tech surveillance by the National Security Agency or a tip by a government informant, but a tip to the FBI by the girls' worried families.Assad Ibrahim, the Sudanese-American father of one of the girls, received a call from his daughter's Denver school telling him she was missing. When he tried calling her, she did not pick up.Ibrahim went to the father of the other two girls to check whether their passports were missing. They were.The families then went to the FBI, which intercepted the girls at the Frankfurt airport.The key role that families play in preventing violent extremism is often overlooked in favor of focusing on more exotic counterterrorism measures such as the National Security Agency's surveillance programs or the use of paid informants.In fact, a survey by the New America Foundation of 251 jihadist terrorism cases in the United States since 9/11 found that almost a third of the individuals accused of engaging in some kind of terrorist crime have been implicated by a tip from a family member or a member of the Muslim-American community.By contrast, only a little more than 1% of these cases was generated by one of the NSA's most controversial surveillance programs, in which the agency collected every American's phone data for several years.Families are often critical in stopping radicalizing individuals from stepping over the edge into militant activity. Take Adam Dandach, a 20-year-old Orange County man who was charged in July with committing passport fraud in an effort to join ISIS. His mother hid his passport so he could not leave the country.When more than 20 Somali-Americans left from Minnesota after 2007 to fight for the al Qaeda affiliated Al Shabaab group in Somalia, family and community members played critical roles in the ensuing FBI investigation.After Abdirizak Bihi's nephew, Burhan Hassan, left to fight for Al Shabaab in Somalia in November 2008, Bihi worked to organize community cooperation with the government's investigation.As Ralph Boelter, who oversaw the FBI's investigation, put it in 2009 when the Justice Department unsealed charges against eight men accused of supporting Al Shabaab, 'It is through the sustained and dedicated efforts of the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force and the support of the Somali-American community that today we are able to disclose some of the significant progress we have achieved in this critical investigation.'.Families are not a panacea. Sometimes family members intervene with a radicalizing individual, but the intervention doesn't work.Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old Colorado woman, pleaded guilty in September to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. Her family sought to dissuade her from seeking to join jihadists in Syria, but their efforts failed and she was arrested on April 8 at Denver International Airport on her way to Syria.Samir Khan traveled to Yemen from Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2009 where he became the editor of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine despite several attempts by his family members and elders from the local Muslim-American community to dissuade him from his militant views.Two years later Khan was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen.Sometimes a family will warn U.S. authorities about a radicalizing child, but the warning isn't sufficiently followed up on. The Nigerian 'underwear bomber,' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to blow up a bomb secreted in his underwear over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Luckily the bomb failed to detonate.A month earlier, Abdulmuttalab's father had gone to the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, and told State Department officials there that he believed his son was meeting with extremists in Yemen. The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria issued a warning to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, but Abdulmuttalab was not put on the 'no fly' list and the center's analysts did not make an effort to determine if Abdulmuttalab possessed a valid U.S. visa.Families are often, of course, the first to notice if a son or daughter is radicalizing and are a key bulwark against extremism. Why and how some people radicalize is a subject that is complex, but one indicator is usually unambiguous and that is that radicalizing individuals will often spend a great deal of time on jihadist websites or consuming jihadist social media.Many parents don't have much of a clue about what is happening online, but a common sense approach if they suspect their son or daughter is radicalizing is to get a better handle on their children's social media use and profile.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T23:00:18Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141003125257-01-syrian-refugees-1003-restricted-story-top.jpg", "id": 4304}, {"title": "Nigeria and Boko Haram reach ceasefire deal", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/17/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-ceasefire/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Nigeria has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Islamist terror group Boko Haram that includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls, Nigerian officials said Friday.The deal came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan.'We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,' Tukur said.Officials provided few details about the release.Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, did not specify when the girls would be freed. He said not all would be let go at once, but a 'significant number' would be released soon.'A batch of them will be released shortly, and this will be followed by further actions from Boko Haram,' he said. 'It is a process. ... It is not a question of hours and days.'The Nigerian government consented to some demands by Boko Haram, but Okupe declined to provide details.The government, he said, 'is looking beyond the girls. We want to end the insurgency in this country.''On the war front,' he added, 'we can say there is peace now.'The agreement was first reported by Agence France-Presse.The terrorist group abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing.Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur.'The group has shown willingness to abide by the agreement which it demonstrated with the release of the Chinese and Cameroonian hostages few days ago,' Tukur said.In cross-border attacks by Boko Haram this week, eight Cameroonian soldiers and 107 group members were killed in heavy fighting that lasted two days in northern Cameroon, the country's defense ministry said Friday, according to state broadcaster CRTV.The militants led an incursion near Limani, close to the border with Nigeria, on Wednesday, equipped with heavy weapons, including at least one tank, CRTV said, citing information from the defense ministry.The fighting lasted two hours and resumed on Thursday, when Cameroonian soldiers forced the militants back across the border into Nigeria. Seven Cameroonian soldiers were injured. A Boko Haram tank and other vehicles were destroyed and weapons and ammunition were seized by Cameroonian forces, according to CRTV.A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap.Where are the missing girls?The name 'Boko Haram' translates to 'Western education is sin' in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa.In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government.The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.Boko Haram was founded 12 years ago by Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic cleric who called for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria.

A senior U.S. official and a Western diplomat tell CNN that it's not so much that the U.S. and Iranian militaries are cooperating with each other, they're just communicating so they stay out of each other's way, since they're operating in the same areas. The Iraqis are serving as intermediaries since Washington and Iran don't have diplomatic relations.More on this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:27:10Z", "top_image": "http://z.cdn.turner.com/cnn/tmpl_asset/static/blog/274/elements/newday/share-newday-300.jpg", "id": 5729}, {"title": "Online, pics show Ottawa soldier as dad, dog lover", "url": "http://www.hlntv.com/article/2014/10/23/nathan-cirillo-ottawa-shooting-victim", "text": "Thirteen days ago, Nathan Cirillo posted this photo collage on Instagram of three pictures of his dogs, including one showing him half-asleep sharing his covers with his German and Belgium shepherds.

But among a laundry list of dangerous places was this sentence: 'Terrorist organizations continue to be active in Yemen, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).'It was a brief, generic commentary on the group still regarded by many analysts as al Qaeda's most effective affiliate, and which is now exploiting a surge in political turmoil in Yemen. As a reminder of how dangerous AQAP is, the State Department on Tuesday published an unusual 'wanted' list 'offering rewards totaling up to $45 million for information leading to the locations of eight key leaders' of the group.The U.S. has invested heavily in Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who was elected in 2012 and pledged to reverse gains that AQAP had made in the south and east of the country. Hadi reorganized Yemen's military, and for a while -- with considerable US assistance -- it put AQAP on the defensive.But on September 21, the country's always combustible political landscape exploded when Houthi rebels seized government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and its airport. The Houthi are Shia Muslims who make up an estimated 30% of the population but have long felt marginalized by the Sunni majority in Yemen. They are now demanding greater political influence.That is a red rag to radical Sunnis, including supporters or members of AQAP, who regard the Houthi as apostates to be driven from Muslim lands or killed. They claim Iran is bankrolling the Houthi rebellion in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast, on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Monday's capture by Houthi militia of much of the coastal city of Hodeida -- Yemen's second-largest port -- will only heighten that fear.Even Hadi has alleged that the Houthis are being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing apprehension.On Monday, Hadi appointed a new Prime Minister, Khaled Bahah, who is currently Yemen's envoy at the United Nations. Some Houthi leaders spoke positively of Bahah's appointment, but unless Houthi militia are reined in, Yemen could quickly become another theater in the Sunni/Shia confrontation gripping much of the Middle East.AQAP is doing as much as it can to stoke a sectarian war. Last week, it launched a devastating suicide bombing against a Houthi rally in Sanaa, which killed nearly 50 people. It also released a video showing its fighters purportedly removing 14 Houthi men from a bus and executing them. At the same time, AQAP has stepped up attacks against the army and police; a suicide bombing at a military checkpoint in remote Hadramaut province last week killed 20 soldiers.In recent weeks, the group has released a series of appeals to Sunnis in Yemen to support its campaign against the Houthis, casting itself as the only group capable of preventing what it claims is a plot by Iran to take over the country. Its videos and statements refer to the 'Yemeni turned Houthi army.''Do not leave a checkpoint for (the Houthis) that you do not strike, nor a headquarters that you do not bomb, nor a troop carrier that you do not explode,' said one of AQAP's leaders, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, in a video released on September 30, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group.Hardline Sunnis in Yemen have staged anti-Houthi demonstrations in recent weeks. And even some in government may now see AQAP as a useful counterweight to the Houthis. The worst-case scenario: a repeat of 2011, when roiling protests in the capital and infighting between different army units allowed AQAP to seize control of several towns in southern Yemen -- towns they held for months. Now, there is the additional destabilizing factor of a growing secessionist movement in the south.Once again, Yemen seems close to becoming a failing state; the sort of place where al Qaeda incubates quickly.The main threat to AQAP may be from within, as some jihadists opt for the even more radical option of ISIS. There is now a group called The Islamic State Supporters in the Arabian Peninsula, which has promised attacks against Houthis. According to Flashpoint Partners Intelligence, which monitors jihadist communications, one former AQAP commander, Ma'moun Hatem, has already pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Assuming AQAP can avoid defections, its ability to plan terror attacks beyond the Middle East remains far greater than that of ISIS. U.S. officials say AQAP still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb-making know-how with jihadists in Syria, specifically within an al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra.AQAP chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri has three times plotted to bring down U.S.-bound aircraft, coming closest to success on Christmas Day in 2009 when a Nigerian recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above Detroit.Earlier this year, AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, who is also al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri's deputy, told a large gathering of fighters that attacking the United States was a central priority, a message repeated by al-Ansi last month.'Each front must strike America and its interests everywhere. We have recognized the main enemy, America, for decades,' al-Ansi said.While debate rages in Washington and Europe about the intentions of ISIS and al-Nusra in exporting terror to the West, the most lethal of al Qaeda's affiliates is exploiting and stoking Yemen's latest crisis.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-16T04:11:37Z", "top_image": "", "id": 1321}, {"title": "19 precious monuments destroyed by war", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/gallery/precious-monuments-lost-in-middle-east-conflicts/index.html", "text": "It is a cruel irony that a region so blessed with the treasures of early human civilizations is also among those most troubled by conflict.

Patrick Ryder.'We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.'ISIS has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of western and northern Iraq, for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate.This week has seen an increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Aleppo.The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there.The Pentagon said its increased focus on the area reflected greater opportunity rather than a strategic shift with regards to the importance of helping the Kurds hold Kobani.'What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it,' said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN Friday that Kobani is not tactically or militarily very important -- but has taken on a certain significance.'It's a small little town along the border with Turkey, he said. 'However, it has attracted the attention of the world.'The world is watching the coalition fight ISIS and, because of that, a victory by either side in Kobani will have a psychological and strategic communication victory that far outweighs the tactical military victory to whichever side wins.'In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, on the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands.Meanwhile, in Iraq's western Anbar province, ISIS militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Falluja, a provincial official said Thursday.ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thursday.Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town.The deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi, told CNN by phone Friday that a curfew has been imposed on the city of Ramadi until further notice.This was prompted by fear of potential suicide attacks by ISIS fighters, particularly during Friday prayers, he said. The curfew was imposed Thursday night.Al-Issawi told CNN the situation in Ramadi was critical, with 'heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and their supporters from one side and the ISIS militants from another.'Car bomb attacks claimed by ISIS targeted Shia areas of Baghdad Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring more.CNN's Raja Razek reported from near Suruc, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Jason Hanna in Atlanta.

The Pentagon failed to recognize the scope of the problem, track it adequately or offer proper treatment to those who may have been injured.  In fact the problem only became public when The Timess Chris Chivers reported last month on the cases of 17 American service members who were injured by sarin or sulfur mustard agent. Since then, he has learned of eight more cases. Meanwhile the Pentagon, at Defense Secretary Chuck Hagels urging, has done an internal review of its records, suggesting the scope of the problem is far greater.The stories of service members who believed they were exposed to chemical weapons, and ignored by their own military, are heartbreaking.A former Army sergeant was exposed to a sulfar mustard agent when he helped destroy buried chemical artillery shells in 2008. When he later developed health problems and raised a possible connection to chemical weapons, he said no one believed him and the link was dismissed.A Navy explosive ordnance disposal technician said that when he sought medical treatment after a splash of mustard agent left a long red patch on his arm, the Army doctor was not interested. An officer in his unit issued an order forbidding the sailor to even talk about the discovery of chemical shells.In an effort to play catch-up, the Pentagon has revived a telephone line, 1-800-497-6261, for veterans to report their possible exposure to chemical weapons.The American government owes it to the tens of thousands of troops who served in Iraq to examine every case, determine the extent of exposure (or not) and provide whatever treatment is appropriate. Congress needs to investigate why troops were not informed of the risk in advance, and why officials felt secrecy was so imperative that they deprived troops of essential medical care.This story should sound familiar. After Vietnam, the Pentagon kept silent on the disastrous effects of Agent Orange. After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, it did not share information about troops exposure to chemical weapons and other risks.

Things are looking good. But suddenly, a horrific terrorist group emerges that calls itself the same name as your company.Do you: A) Change the name of your business? B) Sue the terrorist group for trademark infringement? C) Keep your name and hope customers don't get spooked?Businesses across the United States are facing this very dilemma because the word 'ISIS' is part of their corporate name or product.According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, more than 270 products or business names among active federal trademarks use 'ISIS.' They range from pharmaceutical companies to wig makers to phone apps.OK, so nobody is going for option 'B.' The most common reaction from business owners is option 'A,' dropping the ISIS reference. The latest and most visible example is from the hit FX cartoon series, 'Archer.'Over the weekend, the show's creator, Adam Reed, announced that the series would no longer use 'ISIS' as the acronym for the spy agency 'International Secret Intelligence Service,' which employs the show's main characters. Reed, who plans to come up with a story line to justify the name change for next season, commented that ISIS is 'the most awful thing and we didn't want to have anything to do with it.'FX has even decided to stop selling ISIS hats and shirts. Of course, you can still get them on eBay.Just a few months ago, the mobile payment service known as 'Isis Wallet,' a joint venture with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, changed its name to 'Softcard' in order 'to avoid confusion and association with a violent Islamic militant group.'Small businesses are also being affected. In Queens, New York, the owner of the 'ISIS Hookah Caf' told the Daily News that he wants to change his name but can't afford the costs -- a new sign, documents and all.This is not just an American problem. Last week the owners of 'Caf ISIS' in the United Kingdom felt compelled to change their restaurant's name.But, OK, can we all take a breath here? Both business owners and consumers.Who actually looks at the name of a business with the word ISIS in it and thinks: 'Wow, that terrorist group from the Middle East now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood!' Or believes that a new app that helps you pay your bills is part of a terrorist group's dastardly plan?And, yes, I know ISIS is a heinous organization. So understandably, the word ISIS causes a negative visceral reaction. But we need to let fear give way to intellect and not punish American business owners.Think of the Egyptian goddess Isis -- or the Bob Dylan song from the 'Desire' album. Or the 1970s children's TV show the 'Shazam!-Isis Hour.' The word Isis should conjure up mythology, not mayhem.Perhaps an easy answer is for the media to universally start using the name ISIL instead of ISIS. (My apologies to any 'ISIL Caf' owners out there.) That would be accurate because ISIL stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Plus President Obama and many media outlets already use ISIL, including Reuters and the Associated Press.But what I really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the California company, ISIS Pharmaceuticals, which is keeping its name. As a spokesman for the drug company told The Daily Mail: 'We've been around for awhile.' People 'can easily distinguish between us and a Middle Eastern terrorist group.'So my advice is, if your company or product is called ISIS, keep the name. Why allow a terrorist group to tell you what you can call your business?", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-10-15T15:51:32Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141014165628-obeidallah-isis-lingerie-summers-story-top.jpg", "id": 976}, {"title": "Somali al-Shabab court 'stones teenager to death'", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29724577", "text": "An Islamic court has stoned a teenager to death in southern Somalia after convicting him of raping a woman, a pro-Islamist news site reports.The judge ordered Hasan Ahmad Ali, 18, to compensate the woman with a calf before he was killed, according to an audio recording of the trial.Somalia's militant Islamist group al-Shabab implements a strict version of Islamic law in areas it controls.Last month, a woman was stoned to death in the port town of Barawe after an Islamic court convicted her of having four husbands at the same time.Ali was found guilty of raping Ms Mohmoud at gunpoint in Dharuro village in Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, reports the pro-al-Shabab al-Furqaan radio station on its website.He said he had consensual sex with her.Al-Shabab has recently lost control of several towns, including Barawe, but still controls large swathes of territory in rural areas.The al-Qaeda linked group, which is estimated to have at least 5,000 fighters, wants to overthrow the UN-backed Somali government.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-23T02:43:17Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78449000/jpg/_78449998_islamiccourt.jpg", "id": 3008}, {"title": "ISIS accused of chemical attacks", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/10/25/pkg-starr-isis-chemical-attack.cnn.html", "text": "ISIS forces located 50 miles north of Baghdad allegedly unleashed a chemical attack on Iraqi forces in September.If your browser has Adobe Flash Player installed, click above to play.

The views expressed are his own.(CNN) -- The announcement by senior Nigerian military and government officials that an agreement has been reached with Boko Haram for the release of more than 200 kidnapped Chibok girls is welcome, although it has understandably been greeted with considerable caution. And news that a ceasefire has also been agreed, and that further negotiations will take place, is another positive development.But this is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe.After all, it was only recently that it was announced that Abubakar Shekau, reputed leader of the jihadist group, had supposedly been killed ... again. Yet Shekau, or someone proclaiming to be him, probably lives on in a country where much political, economic and now military affairs take place in the shadows.The problem with establishing what is really going on in Nigeria, and with Boko Haram specifically, is that after five years of warfare and many casualties, there is much that is still uncertain about the group. Indeed, it appears to be both an actual organization and a brand name for banditry.Early reports have claimed that the meetings that resulted in the alleged agreement with Boko Haram took place in Ndjamena, the capital of neighboring Chad, which itself is firmly under the control of an autocratic government. But it is difficult to know for sure what is going on in Nigeria, a place where a significant part of business is conducted by a shadowy combination of political, military, and business individuals. And this is creating even bigger problems for Nigeria than the national and global demands for the girls' rescue.For a start, it has been unclear how Boko Haram is financed -- and how much assistance it might be receiving from disaffected members of the northern Nigerian elite, as well as those holding government positions at the federal and state levels.'Underground' campaigns involving the use of armed thugs have been a staple feature of Nigerian party politics for decades, and international human rights groups have noted a 'dirty war' conducted by soldiers and government-financed militias. These abuses, combined with the dysfunction of the armed forces, complicate external assistance.The problem for Nigeria is that although the jihadists will eventually almost certainly be crushed, as were the secessionists in Nigeria's civil war, the clock is ticking on a greater threat to the Nigerian nation, namely popular protests in northern Nigeria following February's presidential poll, which President Goodluck Jonathan is certain to contest.Boko Haram is a militant, cultist variant of Islamism, and it continues to challenge the secular Nigerian state. Its campaign has tapped into widespread disaffection in the northern region of at least 80 million people, which has been in decline even as the rest of the country experiences economic growth.This is the backdrop to the unfolding drama of the kidnapped girls, who themselves have become pawns in a multilayered drama.If the negotiations announced Friday are genuine, Boko Haram -- which has muscled its way onto the global stage by mimicking jihadist declarations and terrorist actions of others, including the use of suicide bombers -- can command a high price for their release. While the group is still largely a Nigerian phenomenon, and although such militant groups have previously been overwhelmed by the brutal force for which Nigerian soldiers and police are known, Boko Haram is more tenacious and resilient than its predecessors. Moreover, it is now fortified by a powerful global jihadist ideology.So, how should the Nigerian government respond?Friday's announcement suggests that the Chibok girls are alive and well; and a rational course for Boko Haram would be to negotiate an amnesty with the government, following the example of the Delta insurgents.But the announcement, if it can be believed, has implications that stretch beyond these girls' fortunes. Indeed, the campaign for the Nigerian presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat Boko Haram. This means that if the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with Boko Haram and bringing home these girls, Goodluck Jonathan would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts.With a multi-billion government trough at his disposal, it would be hard to bet against him come February. But the way this 'deal' unfolds will have significant implications for his electoral chances and the peace and political stability of Africa's largest nation.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T04:12:35Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140707103132-nigeria-missing-girls-protest-story-top.jpg", "id": 1749}, {"title": "Nigerian government has failed to protect women from Boko Haram, says new report  Amanpour", "url": "http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/27/nigerian-government-has-failed-to-protect-its-women-from-boko-haram-says-new-report/", "text": "By Madalena Araujo, CNN  The Nigerian government has failed to protect its women from a disturbing range of abuses by Boko Haram, the author of a new Human Rights Watch report told CNN's Michael Holmes, in for Christiane Amanpour, on Monday.From being forced into marriage and even to commit murder to rape in captivity, dozens of former hostages have described the extent of the abuse suffered at the hands of the Islamic militant group.What has happened now is that those girls, those students have failed to return to school because they are afraid of being re-abducted and so the failure to protect also fuels the violations of other rights, including the right to education and the rights to live in a secure environment, Mausi Segun, Nigeria Researcher for Human Rights Watch, said.The groups largest single attack took place in April, when 270 schoolgirls were taken from Chibok in the northeastern state of Borno.To illustrate the authorities seeming inaction, Mausi recounted one episode where the police did not request a potentially valuable testimony from a girl who managed to escape her kidnappers.When her parents took her to the local police station to report that she had just returned from three months in Boko Haram captivity, the words of the police to her parents were lucky you, you better go back home and thank your lucky stars that you managed to escape. There was no attempt to document what had happened to her or investigate, she said.Doyin Okupe, Senior Special Adviser to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, hit back at claims that his government has failed to respond properly to Boko Harams sustained campaign of terror and to prevent further abductions. He started by saying that he found some parts of the Human Rights Watch report very patronizing.The federal government of Nigeria and the state government have already directed the schools in the affected areas to be shut down, and alternative arrangements and postings have been made [so] that these children will be posted to neighboring schools and neighboring states where there is safety, he said.Okupe admitted that it is difficult to provide individual safety and security for each person, and the girls or students, or men living in the areas where the extremists operate, but that the entire security problem is something that the military is responding to on a daily basis.The Nigerian government is under mounting pressure after suspected militants kidnapped another 30 children from a village in northeast Nigeria during the weekend, despite the announcement of a ceasefire just days before. Okupe asked people to be patient and allow the administration more time to get the girls back.The talks are going on. Yes there are infringements of the ceasefire and even the Boko Haram people have come [forward] themselves to say this was done by dissidents, this was done by criminals within those societies  and it is not unusual. You know we are talking about an insurgency sect, they have different warlords so they dont all agree at the same time and it is not strange, he said.When asked to comment on a number of recent videos that seem to demonstrate Nigerian security forces carrying out human rights abuses as they hunt for Boko Haram, Okupe said the footage is very questionable.I have seen those tapes myself  they are quite preposterous. Its unbelievable, and I dont think anybody in the Nigerian army will do that. I do not believe that anybody in the Nigerian army, wearing a Nigerian uniform, would do those things that are depicted in those videos.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:43:41Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120202074809-boko-haram-destruction-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 3853}, {"title": "Ottawa shootings: Standing ovation as parliament returns", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-29746466", "text": "The Canadian prime minister has addressed parliament, a day after a gunman rampaged through the building before being shot dead.Prime Minister Stephen Harper said it was 'a terribly sad day' and paid tribute to those risked their lives to protect their country.His comments came after a moment's silence was held for Cpl Nathan Cirillo, who died in the attack.Earlier, the parliamentary Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Vickers, who shot dead the gunman, was given a standing ovation.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:54:29Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3234}, {"title": "Stephen Harper: 'Canada will never be intimidated'", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-29734737", "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said that 'Canada will never be intimidated' after a solider was killed in Ottawa.A gunman shot and killed a soldier at a war memorial in Ottawa, before police engaged in a gun battle inside the parliament building.A gunman has been shot dead, but Canada's capital remains on alert as police hunt for more suspects.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-23T02:40:20Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 2928}, {"title": "ISIS: Can coalition cut off funding of world's wealthiest terror group?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/27/business/isis-wealthiest-terror-group-defterios/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- ISIS has been defined as the wealthiest terrorist group on record, using a combination of black market oil sales, extortion and sophisticated social media to raise money to fund its expansion into Iraq and Syria, according to the U.S. Treasury.A policy to combat ISIS on many fronts is taking shape, but western diplomats here in the Middle East say trying to get coalition members on the same page is proving difficult. The harsh reality remains that despite an ever-increasing focus on ISIS, the group is still pulling in about $1 million a day, according to the U.S. Treasury.A dozen coalition countries led by General John Allen -- U.S. envoy in the fight against ISIS -- met in Kuwait on Monday with a two pronged strategy: to decide what are the best tools to choke off ISIS financing and to win the hearts and minds of the Muslim world in terms of messaging.Another part of this effort is getting coalition members to agree on the final goal. Some big regional Sunni powers, specifically Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are still eager to purse a broader coalition campaign which includes taking down Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This remains a stumbling block on the path to an effective coalition.But there are indications that a more defined strategy against ISIS has emerged over the past week. In his address to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Thursday, the lead official on ISIS financing said progress had been made before going on to name those countries which are lagging behind.READ MORE: Former U.S. soldier battles ISISDavid Cohen, the Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury, said both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have both made progress in choking off funds from wealthy Gulf Arab trading groups that support what many defined as a broader Sunni cause in support of ISIS. However, Cohen went onto to say both Qatar and Kuwait remain 'permissive jurisdictions for terrorist financing.'That is a strong statement considering Kuwait has set up a financial intelligence unit and Qatar passed a law regulating fundraising by charities within the tiny but wealthy Gulf state with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.Pressure on Qatar is coming from both sides of the Atlantic. Douglas Alexander, the British Labour Party's shadow foreign secretary, said the visit of Qatar's young Emir to London this week is the ideal opportunity to apply more pressure.Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister David Cameron later this week to define the efforts put forth to undermine ISIS. The ability for the Prime Minister to lean on Qatar is complicated by the Gulf state's spending spree in London as owner of Harrods, the London Shard building and a slew of other prime assets.Meanwhile, as I reported at the beginning of September, ISIS's oil production and distribution network is not what it was just a few months ago, when up to 70,000 barrels of crude was finding its way onto the black market.Cohen from the U.S. Treasury suggests -- using his revenue number of a million dollars -- that production has been reduced to 25,000 barrels and that the Assad regime is still on the receiving end of that ISIS-controlled oil. Now the coalition wants both the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and Turkey to close off routes used to distribute that oil. Both have reportedly made pledges to do so. Over the past week U.S. airstrikes are supporting an Iraqi military effort on the ground to finally secure the Baiji refinery north of Mosul.The effort to pull 60 countries of a coalition together, diplomats tell me, is as complicated as the region itself -- especially with so many countries vying for the upper hand.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:39:52Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140614092853-isis-fighters-iraq-story-top.jpg", "id": 3770}, {"title": "Parents of ISIS Hostage Peter Kassig Hope Send Message of Love", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/parents-isis-hostage-peter-kassig-hope-send-message-love-n224216", "text": "The parents of ISIS hostage Peter Kassig tell NBC News that they are speaking publicly about their son in hopes that he will somehow hear their message of support and love.

Programming related to Tuesdays observance is plentiful, and a lot of it seems determined to throw off the stodginess sometimes associated with the holiday, whose roots are in World War I.The Smithsonian Channel, for instance, has a Sunday night special that is both historical and as contemporary as todays box office. Its called Tanks of Fury, and it compares tank warfare as depicted in the movie Fury, which was released last month, with the real thing.The film tells the story of a Sherman tank crew in World War II, and the Smithsonian program features lots of behind-the-scenes material on how the movie was made. One rather terrifying segment shows a stuntman being lit on fire and then leaping from a burning tank. But even more terrifying are the descriptions of actual combat from veterans and historians, among them the descriptions of what a German anti-tank weapon called a Panzerfaust did when it struck.That molten jet just blasts right through the armor and sprays the inside of the troop compartment with red-hot molten metal fragments, says Rob Lihani, military technical adviser on the film.Another movie, Quentin Tarantinos 2009 Inglourious Basterds, also inspires a program, The Real Inglorious Bastards, on Tuesday night on the American Heroes Channel. It tells the story of an astounding spy mission conducted during World War II by Jewish refugees who returned to Nazi-occupied Europe undercover. The program ends with a touching Skype call between two participants, Frederick Mayer and Hans Wijnberg.He looks terrific, Mr. Mayer says after disconnecting. A little bit older, but still the same boy face.Another program with a current feel comes from PBS: Navy SEALs  Their Untold Story, being broadcast on Tuesday night. These specially trained commandos have been in the news lately as more details have emerged about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and, more generally, they have gained a sort of superhero image.The program does its share of adding to this gloss. While fewer than 10,000 men have ever been Navy SEALs, they greatly define the modern battle space, the narration says. But it also gets beneath the mythology by tracing the origins of the units we know today back to World War II and the underwater demolition teams deployed at places like Normandy, assigned to clear obstacles ahead of the D-Day landings.One of the more startling bits of history revisited in the program is the militarys experiment with backpack-size nuclear weapons in the mid-1960s. Despite their size, some of these nuclear weapons were more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima, the narration says, and the SEALs were trained to carry them.Other programs continue to tell the stories of recent veterans struggling to readjust after service in Iraq or Afghanistan, some with visible wounds and many others with psychological ones.Got Your 6, on Tuesday afternoon on MTV, follows four young men as they try to blend back into domestic life after fighting in Afghanistan. The presentation is very MTV-like  peppy, youth-oriented, with a soundtrack that could be an album  and, at times, the program seems as if it were a recruitment video. But the problems the men face are grown-up ones: damaged relationships, haunting memories.Got Your 6 takes its title from an expression referring to positions on a clock that means Ive got your back. A veteran in Dogs of War, a series that premieres on Tuesday on A&E, invokes that same phrase to explain what he hopes a new dog will be able to do for him. His post-traumatic stress disorder leaves him constantly wary of what is behind him. A dog, he hopes, really will watch his back so he can be at ease when out in public.The series looks at the work of Paws and Stripes, an organization founded by Jim (he is an Iraq war veteran) and Lindsey Stanek that trains shelter dogs to be service dogs and then pairs them with veterans who might benefit from such animals. Its a win-win, when it works, though, as Mr. Stanek notes in the premiere, hitting the right chemistry between animal and veteran isnt easy.You can want something so bad for a veteran, and you can want something so bad for a dog, and sometimes it just doesnt work, he says.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:08:13Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/08/arts/subvettv2/subvettv2-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 5488}, {"title": "#BBCTrending: Kevin Vickers hailed as Canadian hero", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-29730233", "text": "On Wednesday afternoon, after Canadian House of Commons Sgt-at-arms Kevin Vickers reportedly shot a gunman in a parliament building in Ottawa, he was hailed on Twitter as Canada's hero.Before his name was announced on news outlets like the BBC, he was trending on social media.

Over the weekend, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town, killing at least eight and kidnapping others.David Cook, who studies jihad, has doubts about the deal going through.'It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled president, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,' he wrote in an analysis for CNN.The Islamists have employed particularly bloody tactics this year, killing thousands,Boko Haram has gone after Christians, foreigners and educated people, driving them out of the country's northeast. And they have continued kidnapping.They have often sidelined Nigeria's army. And government soldiers have at times mutinied, complaining of lacking support from the government.Jonathan needs some good news going into February's polls.'This is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe,' he wrote after the government's announcement.He fears that after so much war, the group may be disjointed and any ceasefire deals made with some members may not be heeded by others.And like ISIS, Boko Haram has ambitions for a caliphate or religious state, which would mean it has long-term ambitions to keep fighting, Cook said.But he believes that a deal could still be in Boko Haram's interest. They could use it to rest and regroup.On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the village of Chibok and kidnapped an estimated 276 teenage girls from a boarding school. Officials there say some of the girls were able to escape.It is believed that the Islamist militants were able to hold on to more than 200 of them.Three weeks later, a man claiming to be a Boko Haram leader threatened to sell the girls into slavery. 'Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,' he said.More than a month after their abduction, the White House announced it had sent 80 U.S. troops to Chad to help search for the kidnapped schoolgirls.In spite of many promises to find and free them, the girls have remained in the terrorists' hands.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T22:08:04Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141018163548-ireport-boko-haram-free-our-girls-day-count-00013217-story-top.jpg", "id": 2039}, {"title": "US envoy: 'Britain will support IS strategy'", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-29730125", "text": "The US envoy tasked by President Barack Obama with building a coalition against Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria has spoken to BBC Newsnight's Laura Kuenssberg.Retired Gen John Allen told the programme that Britain would support the 'strategy' to combat the militants.

He said the group would continue to attack the pillars of the infidel system now governing Pakistan.The attack came four months after the Pakistani military began an offensive against the Taliban in North Waziristan, a rugged northwestern tribal region that had long served as a redoubt for various local and foreign militants. The suicide bombing on Sunday appeared to be the first major retaliatory strike by the militants in mainland Pakistan.Mr. Sukhaira said intelligence reports had noted that terrorists could target the Wagah border post. But it is very difficult to thwart a suicide attack, he said.Spectators viewing the ceremony have to pass through two security checkpoints before entering the site.Pakistani officials said the suicide bomber detonated the explosives in front of a line of shops 500 to 600 yards from the main site, at a time when security was lax after the flag-lowering ceremony had concluded.Attendance was high on Sunday because it was a holiday, and many visitors had come from other towns and cities.Maj. Gen. Tahir Javed Khan, the director general of the Punjab Rangers, told reporters at Wagah that three Rangers officials were among those killed in the attack.General Khan said the bomber could not reach the main site because of the strict security arrangements and detonated the explosives on the outer cordon. Otherwise, the dimensions of the damage could have been very different, he added.In attacking the Wagah ceremony, the Taliban struck at a totemic symbol of patriotism for both India and Pakistan, nuclear-armed neighbors who have fought three major wars since 1947. The ceremony takes place every day, just before the border closes.In the ceremony, towering Pakistani and Indian soldiers stamp their feet and goose step around one another, sometimes just inches apart, in a confrontational yet carefully choreographed spectacle. Indian and Pakistani civilians, crowded on either side of the border, cheer and shout nationalist slogans.About 5,000 to 7,000 people attend every day on the Pakistani side, General Khan of the Rangers said.Muhammad Nawaz, 25, a resident of Lahore, said 14 members of his family went to see the border-closing ceremony; three were killed and seven wounded.Mr. Nawaz said his family was moving toward the exit when the blast shook everything. I saw my brothers body blowing up in front of my eyes, he said.Also among the dead were eight members of a family from Faisalabad, in central Punjab, most of them girls.Saqib Latif, another Lahore resident, said five of his family members went to the ceremony; one was killed.It was a holiday, and we decided to watch the parade, Mr. Latif said. As soon as we left the exit, we heard a blast and fell down on the ground, he added. It was chaotic.

But it represented a significant shift from his earlier position that while he would welcome congressional backing, he had legal authority to take military action under existing statutes.Administration officials said Mr. Obama still believed he had that authority, but with the elections over, he concluded that the time was right to petition Congress for more explicit authority.The world needs to know we are united behind this effort and that the men and women of our military deserve our clear and unified support, Mr. Obama said, adding that he would begin a dialogue with congressional leaders when they come to the White House on Friday.He also increased the pressure on Irans leaders ahead of a deadline this month to reach a nuclear deal, saying that the United States has now presented to them a framework that would allow them to meet their peaceful energy needs, without leaving Iran the ability to break out and produce a nuclear weapon.The president suggested that he was now waiting for a political decision in Tehran about whether Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would accept that framework.While Mr. Obama gave no specifics, he appeared to be referring to a plan under which Iran would ship much of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it would be converted into fuel for the countrys single nuclear plant.Iranian officials dismissed the report without fully denying it, but American officials have said they suspect a struggle is underway within the Iranian government on the wisdom of reaching an accord. They have their own politics, and theres a long tradition of mistrust between the two countries, Mr. Obama said.The president was guarded about the progress of the military operation against the Islamic State. He said it was too soon to say whether the United States and its allies were winning, noting that it would take a long time to upgrade Iraqi forces to the point where they could reclaim territory now held by the militants. He was even more circumspect about Syria.Our focus in Syria is not to solve the entire Syria situation, but rather to isolate the areas in which ISIL can operate, he added, using an alternative name for the Islamic State.That statement appeared somewhat at odds with a recent memo sent to the White House by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, in which he criticized the administrations Syria policy for failing to connect the campaign against the Islamic State to the broader struggle against President Bashar al-Assad.Mr. Hagel wrote that unless the United States clarified its intentions against the Assad regime, it would fail to enlist allies like Turkey and France for the battle against the Islamic State in Syria, since those countries are intent on ousting Mr. Assad. Other officials said that in internal debates, Mr. Hagel has not advocated taking a strong line against Mr. Assad, and in fact has echoed thePentagons resistance to going to warwith the Syrian government.That will be one of the issues likely to come up in a congressional debate over authorization. Before the election, Congress passed limited authorization to pay for the training and equipping of Syrian rebels. Now the White House is seeking an authorization to use military force that would be tailored to a prolonged fight against ISIS.Until now, the White House had justified its airstrikes in Iraq and Syria under two existing laws: a 2001 authorization passed after the 9/11 attacks, which Mr. Obama has invoked to carry out drone and missile strikes against suspected terrorists in Yemen and Somalia, and a 2002 authorization sought by President George W. Bush for the Iraq war.The idea is to right-size and update whatever authorization Congress provides to suit the current fight rather than previous fights, Mr. Obama said. We now have a different type of enemy.Lawmakers welcomed the announcement, even as they noted it would set off complicated political crosscurrents in both parties. Many lawmakers were privately relieved that the White House did not petition Congress before the midterm elections.This is an extended military campaign and it has nothing to do with the 9/11 authorization, said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. It is expensive, long term, and its not clear where its going. Youre going to see a complicated debate in Congress.Among the issues he predicted would come up would be the deployment of American ground forces, which Mr. Obama has ruled out but which Mr. Welch said would almost certainly be needed to root out the militants.Still, he added: In some ways, it will probably be a better debate. People will have more latitude to consider it on the merits than they would have before the election.In part because the battle with the Islamic State is likely to last beyond Mr. Obamas presidency  and soak up resources he wanted to commit elsewhere  there is an increasing sense that the White House is more eager than ever to strike even an agreement in principle with Iran by the Nov. 24 deadline for the end of negotiations.Mr. Obama seemed intent on answering critics who have said he wants a deal too much. Whether we can actually get a deal done, were going to have to find out over the next three to four weeks, he said, suggesting that the framework given to Iran was essentially an effort to determine the sincerity of the countrys insistence that it was simply looking for a reliable way to produce fuel for nuclear reactors.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-06T02:18:26Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5022}, {"title": "Airstrikes hit ISIS targets in Syria, Iraq", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/18/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Airstrikes like those that have helped slow the advance of ISIS fighters in the Syrian town of Kobani rocked the city again Saturday.A huge plume of smoke rose over the city's center in the aftermath of an apparent airstrike that hit the area with three large blasts, according to CNN crews watching from bordering Turkey.While accounts from within the city differed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian Kurdish forces who have retaken parts of the city fought with ISIS fighters south of the city, near the border crossing with Turkey.A fighter in Kobani who declined to be identified for security reasons said clashes also occurred in the city's eastern neighborhoods.A civilian who similarly declined to be identified said there was no front-line fighting or shelling of the city.Kurdish and Free Syrian Army forces were fanning out across the city probing for ISIS soldiers, the fighter told CNN.Opinion: From guerrillas to conquerors: How ISIS has changedU.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in Kobani, the U.S. Central Command said Saturday. Both targeted ISIS fighting positions, the military said.That's far fewer airstrikes than in recent days -- U.S. jets flew at least 14 missions near Kobani on Thursday and Friday, according to Central Command.And although Central Command commander Gen. Lloyd Austin warned Friday that the city still could fall, ISIS militants appear to have vanished from at least portions of the city, the Kobani fighter told CNN.While the Kurdish and Free Syrian Army troops feel victorious, the fighter said they remain wary of ambushes and booby traps left behind.The civilian who spoke to CNN said water has become an issue, with residents and fighters drawn to wells that are common for homes in the city.In other developments in the fight against ISIS:-- At least seven civilians died in a U.S. airstrike on an ISIS-controlled oilfield near the city of Khusham, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Three more died in a strike near the village of Kabiba, the group said.The U.S. Central Command said that it had bombed ISIS crude oil collecting points and refineries, including three strikes on a facility northeast of Khusham. The military statement, however, made no mention of civilian casualties.-- Airstrikes also targeted ISIS units in Iraq, destroying an armed vehicle a machine gun position, a building occupied by the group and three guard shacks near Bayji. Airstrikes near Mosul hit an ISIS building, machine gun and vehicle and three small ground units.-- Iraq's Parliament approved the appointment of a Shiite to the job of interior minister and a Sunni as defense minister, a member of the parliament, Ali al-A'laq, told CNN.

His repatriation was the first transfer to result from a new system of parole-board-like hearings to periodically review whether it is still necessary to keep holding prisoners.The Kuwaiti, Fawzi al Odah, was also only the second low-level prisoner to be released from Guantnamo this year. Last year, President Obama pledged to revive his efforts to close the prison. Administration officials said an end-of-the-year flurry might be coming: The Pentagon has notified Congress that nine other detainees, including six bound for Uruguay, may soon be transferred.Still, there are signs that disagreements remain within the administration over how much risk to accept as it tries to winnow down the population of low-level inmates and close the prison. The administration had been poised to repatriate four Afghans who have long been approved for transfer, but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently pulled back from that plan, according to officials.The officials, who discussed deliberations on the condition of anonymity, said the administration decided at a principals committee meeting on Oct. 3 in the White House Situation Room to proceed with notifying Congress that it intended to repatriate the four Afghans. Mr. Obamas national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, chaired the meeting.The notice was supposed to be given within a week after the State Department obtained an unspecified security assurance from the Afghan government. That was completed three weeks ago, the officials said, but Mr. Hagel has not sent the notice.Although the Pentagon signed off on the Afghans repatriation as part of a 2009 interagency task force, officials familiar with the deliberations said Mr. Hagel had decided to reassess the timing after Gen. John F. Campbell, the top military leader in Afghanistan, sent a memo expressing concerns that they might attack American or Afghan troops.The officials also said Mr. Hagel was still considering the proposed Afghan transfers. His spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, declined to specifically comment about the Afghans. But he described the departments deliberations about whether the security risk has been mitigated as including inputs from commanders in the field, whose perspectives are not only greatly valued by the secretary but heavily relied upon.It is unusual for a cabinet secretary to independently reconsider a decision reached at a principals committee meeting. But Guantnamo transfers are an unusual type of policy decision because of a law requiring that the secretary of defense notify lawmakers at least 30 days before any transfer that he has personally determined that it would be in the national interest.In an agreement with the Kuwaiti government, Mr. Odah, whose name is sometimes spelled Fouzi al Awda, will live in custody there as part of a yearlong rehabilitation program, officials said.He was the first detainee of any type to be transferred since May, when the Obama administration sent five high-level Taliban prisoners  who were not recommended for release  to Qatar in a prisoner swap for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only American prisoner of war from the Afghan war. Angering lawmakers, Mr. Hagel did not provide 30 days notice to Congress for that swap; the administration said any delay could have endangered Sergeant Bergdahls life.Mr. Hagels apparent decision to pull back from swiftly repatriating the Afghans came amid turbulence prompted by an inaccurate Fox News report about former Guantnamo detainees fighting in Syria.Specifically, Fox News reported last Thursday that as many as 20 to 30 former Guantnamo Bay detainees released within the last two to three years are suspected by intelligence and Defense officials of having joined forces with the Islamic State and other militant groups inside Syria.In fact, since January 2011, a total of 22 detainees had left the prison, of whom no more than two  perhaps none  are suspected or confirmed of re-engagement worldwide, according to semiannual reports issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. An official said there had been no Syria-related change to its numbers since the most recent report.Fox News later altered its report, without noting that it was changed, so that it instead reads some of whom were released within the last three years. But its original version had already set off anger in Congress.Representative Howard P. McKeon, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, released letters to the administration last Thursday calling for a moratorium on transfers, citing public reports and a public report today about former Guantnamo detainees joining the Islamic State.The U.S. government must not release terrorist detainees at the same time we have committed U.S. service members to fight ISIL, Mr. McKeon wrote, using an alternate acronym for the Islamic State. To continue to do so just as we have had to open a new front in the war on terror is unthinkable.The Islamic State has used Guantnamo for propaganda purposes, forcing captured journalists to wear orange prison garb, similar to that of detainees, as it beheaded them. Patrick Ventrell, a National Security Council spokesman, said keeping the prison open was itself a risk.Guantnamo poses profound risks to our national security and should be closed, Mr. Ventrell said. The American people should not be spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a facility that harms our standing in the world, damages our relationships with key allies and emboldens violent extremists.Since 2009, the executive branch has used a more stringent process of individualized review before releasing detainees. About 19 percent of former detainees released during the Bush administration have been deemed confirmed recidivists, compared with 6.8 percent of those released under the Obama administration.Mr. Odah, the Kuwaiti released on Wednesday, was a plaintiff in a case that helped establish that courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus lawsuits filed by Guantnamo detainees. But in 2009, a judge upheld Mr. Odahs wartime detention.In July, the Periodic Review Board, which began operating last fall, determined that his detention was no longer necessary, citing his low level of training and lack of a leadership position in Al Qaeda as well as his family support and Kuwaiti security measures.The board found the detainees statements to be credible regarding his commitment not to support extremist groups or other groups that promote violence, and noted the positive changes in the detainees behavior while in detention, it said.His departure leaves 148 prisoners, of whom 79 are recommended for transfer.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-06T02:22:40Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5214}, {"title": "Mexico: American Marine Is Released From Jail", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/americas/mexico-american-marine-is-released-from-jail.html", "text": "An American Marine reservist who had been held in a Mexican jail for months after arriving at the border from California with guns in his vehicle was freed on psychological grounds on Friday, according to court documents.

ISIS, a radical Sunni group, has also destroyed Shia holy sites.Shia militias, said the report, have been taking advantage of the atmosphere of lawlessness and impunity to abduct and kill Sunni men, seemingly in reprisal or revenge for [ISIS] attacks and at times also to extort money from the families of those they have abducted.On June 6, according to interviews conducted by Amnesty, the day after an ISIS incursion into Samarra, 37 Sunni men were abducted and killed from the citys eastern neighborhoods.In Kirkuk on Aug. 24, the day after a triple bomb attack by ISIS, three young Sunni men were abducted.

And I freely admit now, that calculus was wrong.'Military leaders had assumed that the operation in Iraq would have been winding down when troops were deployed to Afghanistan, but in 2005 the situation in Iraq was deteriorating.Lord Dannatt, head of the Army between 2006 and 2009, said: 'Looking back we probably should have realised, maybe I should realised, that the circumstances in Iraq were such that the assumption that we would get down to just 1,000 or 1,500 soldiers by summer 2006 was flawed - it was running at many thousands.'We called it the perfect storm, because we knew that we were heading for two considerable size operations and we really only had the organisation and manpower for one.'And therefore perhaps we should have revisited the decision that we the UK would lead an enlarged mission in southern Afghanistan in 2006. Perhaps we should have done that. We didn't do that.'Lord Richards commanded the 35,000 troops from 37 nations in Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) from 2006-07. He said there was an 'institutional reluctance' to accept the conflict could deteriorate.He said: 'We have a phrase in the Army, hope for the best but plan for the worst. We were actually hoping for the best and planning for the best. I mean I didn't have the resources I needed.'I didn't have a reserve, I didn't even have an aircraft to fly round my own patch. I mean we just weren't in the real world.'In the summer of 2006, some British forces in Afghanistan found themselves effectively stranded in a number of outposts in the north of Helmand province. Overstretched, under constant fire and heavily dependent on helicopters, soldiers ran dangerously low on food, water and ammunition.The commander of the British forces in Helmand in 2006, Brig Ed Butler, said: 'We were underprepared, we were under-resourced, and most importantly, we didn't have a clear and achievable strategy to deliver success.'Lord Dannatt said: 'There was a real danger that we would find that we couldn't support our people, that we would find a platoon cut off and potentially massacred.'But army chiefs remain confident that in the long term, the mission was worthwhile.Gen Wall said: 'The lasting impact we will have had is not just to sanitise the threat to allow the development of governance and economy, but to be a witness to and stimulus for very significant social change, with an improving economy, with jobs, with much developed farming opportunities in contrast to narcotics.'Had we not done this, Helmand could well be looking rather like the borders of Syria and Iraq.'Watch Afghanistan: The Lion's Last Roar on BBC Two on 26 October and 2 November at 21:00 BST.

They live on in memory!' their Kurdish commander, dressed in green camouflage and wearing a pistol on her belt, declares as the scores of uniformed female militants stand at attention.Kurdish fighters from the People's Protection Units (YPG), they have fought the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on the ground for more than a year.They are fighting and bleeding on the front lines of the battle to keep the terror group out of Kurdish-controlled parts of northern Syria -- and to keep this Kurdish movement's ideology, which was founded partly on a pillar of gender equality, intact.'We as women defend and protect our people,' said Hadiye Yusuf, the female co-president of the largest of the three Kurdish enclaves in northern Syria, in an address at the memorial ceremony.'We carry weapons to protect our homes and avoid becoming slaves of ISIS,' she added.The fiercely secular YPG stands in sharp contrast to its bitter enemy, which has kidnapped thousands of women and hid them from public life in the areas that they control -- a chilling reminder of what could await Kurdish women if the war against ISIS is lost.Assistance from the U.S.It was only recently that the YPG started to receive help from the United States in the form of weapons drops and airstrikes designed to blunt the advance of ISIS, which now controls large parts of Syria and Iraq.The much-needed aid was a surprising turn of events for the YPG -- a group that includes many fighters who have long battled Turkey, a key partner in the American-led NATO alliance.But it wasn't until jihadist militants mounted a relentless siege of Kobani, the Syrian border town within sight of international television cameras, that much of the world realized ethnic Kurds were an effective fighting force within Syria.As much of the rest of Syria ripped itself apart in a vicious civil war, Syria's Kurdish minority spent three years quietly building a series of mini-states in the north of the country.They refer to these three enclaves as Rojava. Until recently, some outside observers saw them as something of a success.'They tried to run them as pretty autonomous statelets that were actually rather admirable in some ways. They included many different ethnic groups, faith groups, and they tried to be inclusive,' said Hugh Pope, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, a conflict mediation organization.Bulletins pasted on walls on the streets of one Kurdish-controlled town urge business owners to post signs in the three official languages of Rojava: Kurdish, Arabic, and Syriac -- an ancient Christian language spoken in the Middle East for nearly 2,000 years.'The municipality will help in preparation and translation,' said the bulletins, printed by the municipality of Derik. 'Our language is our identity, our history, our existence and our dignity.'In some ways, the Kurdish-controlled zone feels a world away from many other battle-scarred towns in northern Syria.These areas have barely been targeted by the Syrian government airstrikes and barrel bombs that pummel rebel-held cities and towns, killing at least 182 civilians last week alone, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Unlike the atmosphere in territory controlled by Islamist militias, women in Rojava walk freely on the streets, their hair and faces uncovered.And everywhere, there are posters and graffiti celebrating the bravery and martyrdom of Kurdish fighters from the YPG.At the conclusion of the memorial ceremony last weekend, female fighters -- as well as the mothers and widows of YPG members killed fighting ISIS -- chanted 'Biji sera Apo,' or 'Long Live Apo.'Apo is the nickname of Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. For 30 years, militants from this Marxist-inspired Kurdish separatist movement fought a guerrilla war against the government in nearby Turkey. To this day, Turkey, as well as its NATO allies the United States and the European Union, officially label the PKK a terrorist organization.YPG leaders insist the PKK is a fraternal, though distinctly separate organization.The YPG's iconography and membership suggest otherwise.Ocalan's portrait sits at the center of many posters of slain YPG fighters. In addition, during two trips CNN journalists made to Rojava, CNN encountered at least a dozen armed Kurdish militants of Turkish origin.In an interview with CNN, Yusuf, the enclave co-president, said in her youth she had been a PKK fighter, before eventually becoming an activist in a women's association.The Syrian Kurds' close links to the PKK put Rojava at odds with the Kurdish zone's neighbor to the north: Turkey.That left the enclave of Kobani vulnerable when ISIS mounted its assault last month.'When push came to shove in Kobani, the YPG fighters were terribly exposed and have been dealt very cruel blows,' said the ICG's Hugh Pope.More than 200,000 refugees fled across the border to Turkey to escape the ISIS advance. Meanwhile, Kobani's Kurdish defenders were pushed back almost to the border fence with Turkey in their grim struggle against the jihadi offensive.American airstrikes, and a series of weapons and ammunition air drops, succeeded in loosening the ISIS siege. But the U.S. move to help the Syrian Kurds strained relations with Turkey, whose president called the American aid drops 'a mistake.'While the Syrian Kurds have become a point of tension between two NATO allies, they are also enjoying soaring popularity among Kurds scattered across different countries in the Middle East.Last August, YPG fighters mounted a daring rescue operation across the border into neighboring Iraq. They evacuated thousands of Iraqi Kurds from the Yazidi religious group, who were trapped by ISIS on a barren mountain.Over the last month, the YPG's defense of Kobani has electrified and united Kurds often fractured by linguistic and political divisions.But the popularity has come at great cost.Hundreds of YPG members have been killed, and many more wounded, in the war against ISIS.At the memorial ceremony, a widow named Khalisa Gharzi sat with her daughter and son, watching the speeches.She was in the final month of her pregnancy with her daughter Zhanda last year when her husband Ramadan was killed in a battle with ISIS.Gharzi said her husband's body, when it was recovered, had been mutilated -- one of his ears was severed.'I am angry and sad about what happened to him, but I'm still proud because he was a fighter,' Gharzi said. 'If I didn't have these children, I myself would go and fight. Because this is a just war.'Not far away, her 3-year-old son Hogur played next to rows of female fighters who sat on the parade ground clutching their rifles.The boy was dressed in the green camouflage uniform of a future Kurdish fighter.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T22:59:40Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141029013743-pkg-watson-americas-new-allies-00002120-story-top.jpg", "id": 4288}, {"title": "Obama to Send 1,500 Troops to Assist Iraq", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/world/middleeast/us-to-send-1500-more-troops-to-iraq.html", "text": "WASHINGTON  President Obama has authorized the deployment of an additional 1,500 American troops to Iraq in the coming months, doubling the number of Americans meant to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces.The trainers and advisers are to help Iraqis and Kurds as they plan a major offensive expected next spring against Islamic State fighters who have poured into Iraq from Syria.Pentagon officials said Friday that military advisers would establish training sites across Iraq in a significant expansion of the American military campaign in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State. A Defense Department official said that a number of military personnel would deploy specifically to Anbar Province, the Sunni stronghold in western Iraq that was the scene of bloody fighting for years after the 2003 American-led invasion. In recent months Sunni militants with the Islamic State have been seizing and holding territory across Anbar.In addition, White House budget officials said they would ask Congress for $5 billion for military operations in the Middle East against the Islamic State, including $1.6 billion to train and equip Iraqi troops. At its height in 2006 and 2007, the Iraq war was costing the United States more than $60 billion a year.Administration officials said the expanded effort was intended to help the Iraqis break the Islamic States occupation in northern and western Iraq, re-establish the governments control over the countrys major roads and borders, and retake Mosul, a city of about a million people 250 miles north of Baghdad.The timing of the announcement  three days after the midterm elections  raised the question of whether the administration, wary of angering a war-weary American public, decided to wait until after the elections to minimize further damage to Democratic candidates. For several weeks now, administration officials have said they expected they would have to send additional American troops to help the Iraqi forces, who initially disintegrated in the face of the rampaging Islamic State.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, acting on weeks-old advice from top generals, formally requested the additional troops this week, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. Pentagon officials said that Mr. Hagel was responding to a request from the Iraqi government for the troops and that United States Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East, had assessed the Iraqi units and determined that help was needed.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama has authorized the additional personnel to operate at Iraqi bases, even those outside the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, and Erbil, the Kurdish capital. Until now, American troops have been operating at a headquarters with Iraqi and Kurdish forces in those two cities.Administration officials insisted Friday that the doubling to 3,000 American troops in Iraq was consistent with the presidents policy that the United States is not engaged in combat in Iraq. Mr. Obama, who ran against the Iraq war in his 2008 presidential campaign and pulled all American troops from the country in 2011, has repeatedly ruled out sending ground troops back to Iraq, even as he is deepening American military engagement in both Iraq and Syria.A senior administration official, who asked for anonymity under ground rules imposed by the White House, rejected suggestions that the doubling of forces amounted to mission creep.The mission is not changing at all for our service members, the official said, adding that the president made clear that we are not going to be putting U.S. men and women back into combat. We will continue to assure people that this is a different kind of mission.During a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials denied that Mr. Obama waited until after the elections to announce the deployment so as not to alarm an already skittish electorate. Its being done now, quite frankly, because the Iraqis have demonstrated the willingness and the will to go after ISIL, Admiral Kirby told reporters after the call, using another name for the Islamic State. Iraqi forces, he said, have reached the point where they need additional help and guidance.Admiral Kirby said that Iraqs new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, had requested the help. There was no political angle to the timing here, he said.Administration officials did not express any heightened concern, at least during the conference call, about the military effort. So far it consists largely of American airstrikes on Islamic State artillery positions, vehicles and, in a few cases, small patrol boats on the Euphrates River.White House officials said the request for $5 billion will be presented to Congress during the lame-duck session that begins next week. Officials said the decision to send additional troops was based on what they said was legal authority the president already has from Congress. But they said the president wanted a new authorization from Congress for continuing American military action in Iraq and Syria, which Mr. Obama has said will last into the presidency of his successor.I do think that it points to the utility in the president working with Congress to formulate and implement our counter-ISIL strategy, the official said. If Congress and the president are in agreement on a strategy against the Islamic State, the official said, we send a more united message overseas.Iraqi and Kurdish forces have slowly begun pushing back and retaking territory threatened or captured by the Islamic State in recent weeks, including the Rabia border crossing with Syria, the oil refinery in Baiji north of Baghdad, the northern town of Zumar, and Jurf al-Sakhar, southwest of Baghdad. But officials said the major push will require training three new Iraqi Army divisions, more than 20,000 troops, in the coming months.Since the departure of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the former Iraqi prime minister, American officials have been far more vocal about blaming him for what is widely viewed as a dismal initial performance by the Iraqi military against the Islamic State. On Friday, Admiral Kirby said that the new Iraqi government under Mr. Abadi has shown a new willingness to work to engage Sunni groups, including in Anbar, and to train its soldiers to stand and fight.We did spend a lot of money and effort training the Iraqi Army, Admiral Kirby said. When we left them in 2011, we left them capable. He said the Maliki government squandered the American militarys training of Iraqi troops, but expressed optimism that things will be different now. This is a completely different game, he said, pointing to a recent visit by Mr. Abadi to Anbar Province to engage Sunni leaders in the fight against the Islamic State.Administration officials said they expect international allies will help in the training effort and announced a commitment Friday of 120 military personnel from Denmark to the cause.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:08:46Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5505}, {"title": "ISIS: Will it 'weaponize' foreign fighters? (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/opinion/hegghammer-isis-foreign-fighters/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Thomas Hegghammer is director of terrorism research at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment and author of 'Jihad in Saudi Arabia: Violence and Pan-Islamism since 1979.' The views expressed are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- How big a threat do foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq pose to the West? It's a question that has been much on the mind of policymakers and commentators, especially since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the United States was ramping up its military role in the region. Will such fighters return with dangerous new skills and experience that they are determined to use against their home country? Or is the potential threat by these fighters overhyped?The answer depends on what the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria decides to do with them. So far, jihadi groups in Syria have not been sending foreign fighters on attack missions in the West in any sort of systematic way. But if the group decides to 'weaponize' its fighters, we will have a much bigger problem on our hands.Since 2011, around 3,000 Western Muslims have gone to Syria, where many have joined the most radical elements of the insurgency. And there is no question that some of these individuals will pose a terrorist threat when they return. We know this because it has already happened -- Syria veterans are suspected of involvement in one successful and at least six unsuccessful alleged attacks in Europe and Australia over the past year.Yet there is no reason to expect all -- or even a majority -- of these people to try to attack us in the future. During my research, I have found that of all Western Muslims who joined conflict zones before 2011, no more than one in nine moved on to terrorism in the West. In fact, this estimate is probably at the high end -- the real historical average may be closer to one in 15 or 20.This suggests that the more helpful question is therefore not whether the foreign fighters in Syria are a threat, but what proportion of them will be.Can we not simply assume that somewhere between one in nine or one in 20 of the fighters in Syria will become terrorists, and try to plan accordingly? Unfortunately, it's not that simple because the 'blowback rate' -- the proportion of outgoing fighters who later return to attack -- varies significantly between destinations.Take the conflict in Somalia, for example, which attracted hundreds of Western foreign fighters in the previous decade, but produced few attacking returnees. In contrast, of those who went to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the same period, a substantial proportion plotted attacks on their return.So, how can we determine whether Syria will produce foreign fighters that are more like Somalia or more like Afghanistan and Pakistan in terms of blowback?It largely depends on whether you have a group in the theater of conflict that strategically targets the West. For example, the Afghanistan-Pakistan area has a high blowback rate because it is home to the so-called al Qaeda Central, a group whose sole preoccupation is to mount attacks in the West. Al Qaeda excelled at taking foreign fighters who had come to fight with the Taliban and persuading them to undertake attacks in Europe or the United States instead.Most other jihadi groups, even al Qaeda's own affiliates, are not equally invested in this strategy. True, they all spout anti-American rhetoric and may even dabble in anti-Western extremist actions. But they invest the bulk of their resources in local operations.And so far, that has been true of ISIS, too. Of course, if you look for anti-Western statements and links to potential international plots, you will find them. But these indications actually make up a small proportion of the group's overall ideological production and military operations. The fact is that there is little to suggest that ISIS has had a sustained and centrally directed global operations program.This is one of the reasons why the blowback rate from Syria has so far been low, several plots notwithstanding. Six plots involving a total of, say, 10 or 20 Syria veterans make for a blowback rate of one in 150 or one in 300. Yes, it is still early in the conflict, and several plots may have gone unreported. But Syria is still looking like a low blowback foreign fighter destination.There is, however, the question of whether Western intervention in Iraq and Syria will cause ISIS to go global. Certainly, the group has taken a more anti-Western posture over the past few months. It has repeatedly threatened to attack the United States, and it has beheaded American hostages in Syria.In a noteworthy statement, for example, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani recently called on supporters worldwide to attack members of the coalition in any way possible. So we should not be surprised if ISIS embarks on a limited but sustained external operations effort, along the lines of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, which combines a primarily local agenda with a small global side operation.Ultimately, though, ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda Central has. The organization is not designed for that, and such a strategy is not compatible with its state-building ambitions. Besides, ISIS' threats have so far differed in tone from those of al Qaeda Central. Where the latter says, in effect, that 'we're coming at you regardless,' ISIS has basically been saying, 'We'll come at you if you attack us.' It's a somewhat more reluctant declaration of war.None of this is to suggest that some foreign fighters in Syria won't come back and do bad things regardless of what ISIS' leaders choose to do -- they undoubtedly will. And it is also important to remember one more thing, namely that although the early signs suggest that the threat from foreign fighters returning is low, the potential for attacks is still there.Indeed, if ISIS starts to 'weaponize' its Western recruits in a strategic way, then the foreign fighter threat will take on a more significant -- and more deadly -- complexion than it has so far.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T04:12:32Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141018124040-01-isis-kobani-1018-story-top.jpg", "id": 1747}, {"title": "ISIS bodies dropped off at Syrian hospital", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/19/world/meast/isis-kobani/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- ISIS has apparently taken a heavy hit over the past several days. The bodies of at least 70 fighters for the terror group have been dropped off over four days at a hospital in the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, a Syrian opposition group told CNN. Tal Abyad is on the Turkish border and about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Raqqa.The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria took control of Raqqa last year. ISIS uses the once-liberal city as a kind of headquarters where it applies its hardline interpretation of Islamic law, terrorizing the population.Kurdish and Iraqi forces have been battling ISIS on the ground. With the help of airstrikes from an international coalition led by the United States, the foot soldiers are now focused on pushing ISIS back from its relentless attempt to take Kobani, a Kurdish town on the Syrian-Turkish border.It's unclear who dropped the bodies of the ISIS fighters off at the hospital, but it was likely other fighters from the militant group, because they control Tal Abyad.Sources who work in local medicine confirmed the events to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that promotes ending the longstanding regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The group is based in London and first formed when violence broke out in Syria in 2011, much of it geared toward ousting al-Assad.Kobani now is the scene of an unrelenting battle. On Sunday, the brief moments of calm were punctuated by sounds of firing from both sides. ISIS has shelled the city at least 16 times, sources say, while coalition planes fly low overhead.The strategy against ISIS is working, said U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd Austin on Friday. He also said that Kobani could fall.U.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in the city, Central Command said, both times targeting ISIS fighting positions. That's far fewer strikes than days before. U.S. jets flew at least 14 missions near Kobani on Thursday and Friday, the military reported.It will take 'strategic patience' to beat ISIS, Austin said.The U.S. has generally downplayed the importance of Kobani as a key city in the battle against the militants.However, if ISIS takes Kobani, that would mean it would control land between Raqqa and Turkey -- about 100 kilometers (60 miles).", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T21:46:35Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141019052144-kobani-story-top.jpg", "id": 1857}, {"title": "Chemical Secrets of the Iraq War", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000003160160/chemical-secrets-of-the-iraq-war.html", "text": "The United States went to war in Iraq expecting to destroy an active weapons of mass destruction program.

In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed lower court rulings in Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky that struck down same-sex marriage bans. In October, the Supreme Court announced it would not hear appeals to same-sex marriage cases filed by a handful of states, effectively paving the way for same-sex unions to become legal in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. A handful of states later followed suit. The high court's decision left the door open for future challenges.

Kalli lives in Maiduguri, a city of more than one million and the capital of Borno State, just 80 miles from Chibok, in Nigerias impoverished northeast. For months before the girls were taken, refugees flooded into Maiduguri, fleeing almost-daily Boko Haram raids on nearby villages. The militants arrived on motorcycles and Toyota Hilux trucks, sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes in broad daylight, destroying homes and businesses and killing villagers. By May, a month after the kidnappings, the rebels were coming closer, striking surrounding villages and towns. Maiduguri could only be next.Kalli was trying to stay calm, but he couldnt keep the anxiety and paranoia at bay. Recently, the stress had become so intense that he was hospitalized for eight days. Why was the military not protecting his people? He had grown tired of asking the question. Kalli, a wiry, energetic man of 50 with an affable manner, worked as a government auditor. He was also a unit commander in the Civilian Joint Task Force, a thousands-strong vigilante battalion that was formed in June 2013 to combat Boko Haram. The Civilian J.T.F., as it is known, is made up of volunteers  professionals, civil servants, students and traders  and arms itself with machetes, locally sourced guns and homemade weapons. Kalli led a unit of 8,000.Just after the girls were kidnapped, Kalli and his volunteers, whom he affectionately calls his boys  they call him Elder  arranged to meet local soldiers in Alagarno, a village near the expansive Sambisa Forest, where Boko Haram had set up camps and the girls were thought to be held. But the militarys promised aircraft never arrived, he said. Kalli was angry but not altogether surprised. It wasnt unusual for the military to fail to keep its promises. The governments ineffectiveness in fighting Boko Haram was why he joined the Civilian J.T.F. in the first place.Since the insurgency began in 2009, the militarys response has been both slow and inadequate. Residents report seeing soldiers running away during confrontations with Boko Haram. Soldiers say they do not have enough equipment  they often appear to lack protective gear  and do not get paid on time, if at all. Recently, a military tribunal sentenced 12 soldiers to death for attempted murder and mutiny; they had shot at their commanding officer after a convoy of their fellow soldiers was ambushed by Boko Haram. The governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, angered federal government officials this year when he remarked that Boko Haram outmatched troops in the northeast in both weaponry and motivation. John Campbell, a senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former United States ambassador to Nigeria, makes a similar point: We are talking about a body that is relatively weak, he says, one that has been starved of training and resources for a very long time.In the absence of an effective military response, the job of combating Boko Haram has fallen to the Civilian J.T.F. We are responsible for fighting them, Kalli said. Widely credited with pushing Boko Haram out of Maiduguri a year ago, the Civilian J.T.F. dispenses a summary justice. Much of Kallis time was devoted to tracking down and turning over to government authorities the men and boys suspected of having joined Boko Haram.One Sunday in May, hours before I met up with him at a hotel in Maiduguri that is popular with the military and considered secure, his contact in Yola  the capital of neighboring Adamawa State, where Boko Haram has also waged attacks  called to say someone suspected of being a Boko Haram member was returning to his home in Maiduguri. Kalli guessed that the young man was coming to pick up supplies, perhaps weapons he had stashed somewhere. He gathered his boys and dispatched them to the suspects house in one of the units blue pickup trucks.A few hours later, while Kalli and I sat talking in the hotel, his phone rang. As he listened, he became agitated, twitching with excitement. We got one, he said, hanging up. His boys had captured the suspect. Kalli told me he had to go and rushed out of the hotel.Two days later, I visited Kalli at one of his two homes, a modest bungalow. The power was out, and his third and youngest wife lay on the floor with their three children, fanning them as they napped. I joined Kalli on the couch as he pulled up the cellphone video he shot of the Yola suspect. It showed a young man in black athletic shorts and a red T-shirt, surrounded by men shouting questions at him. The suspect, Mohammed Umar, who could not have been much older than 20, looked dazed. He confessed that he was a member of Boko Haram and that they have been hiding AK-47s in one house, Kalli said gleefully. We asked him to take us to the house. At the first house, we went in and dug but didnt find anything. He took us to three houses. At the third house, we found two AK-47 magazines.When it was over, Kalli and his men, whod been joined by another Civilian J.T.F. commander, handed Umar over to the authorities. He ran away from Maiduguri when we started chasing Boko Haram last year, Kalli explained. Most of them fled. Even now, many of them are living in Lagos, many of them are living in Abuja, many of them are living in Kano. During his first operation in June 2013, Kalli and his boys captured 10 suspects with AK-47s. All were turned over to the military and detained. More recently, in April, he and his boys apprehended nearly 40 people suspected of being Boko Haram members in Abuja, Nigerias capital, 500 miles away. With each mission, Kalli and his unit have become more efficient at rooting out sympathizers. This time, he boasted, the entire operation  from finding Umar to searching the houses to handing him over to Nigerian security forces  took less than 35 minutes.Kalli grew up in Maiduguri, among 18 brothers and sisters. His father was a cow trader and farmer, and his mother, the last of his fathers four wives, was a housewife. Kallis grandfather helped raise him and pushed him to excel at school. As a teenager, Kalli decided he wanted to be a military officer and joined his secondary schools cadet program, a feeder for the best military academy. But his mother worried that he was choosing a risky career, and he ended up studying accounting at a technical college in Maiduguri. He became an auditor, rising through the ranks of the Borno State government, married and soon was prosperous enough to take two more wives and have 20 children.Then Boko Haram began its onslaught against his hometown. Once an ancient center of Islamic teaching and trade, Maiduguri is now a city of sandbagged bunkers and security checkpoints. The attacks were sporadic but chilling. In June 2011, Boko Haram bombed a beer garden; last December, it orchestrated bombings near the airport and on a military air base. Boko Haram attacked civilians seemingly at random. Kallis brother was assassinated in his own home in 2011. It really hurt me, he recalled. But we were handicapped, we couldnt do anything. We were even afraid to report it to the military or authorities, because if you report it, a few days later Boko Haram will just come and kill you. This was not the Nigeria he knew.Men of Kallis generation were among the last to benefit from the countrys post-independence, oil-driven economic expansion. In the 1960s and 70s, a high-school graduate could easily find a good job. The Nigerian naira was on par with the British pound. Nigeria was so wealthy, in fact, that it almost didnt matter that billions of dollars were lost to graft. But deep social and economic rifts existed just below the surface. Pieced together in 1914 and controlled by the British until its independence in 1960, Nigeria was loosely divided along religious lines, with a mostly Muslim, ethnically diverse north and an equally diverse, predominantly Christian south. Under British rule, the north was governed via local emirs, which did not interfere with the regions Muslim identity, while the south was more directly controlled by the British. The south eventually developed an economy centered on oil; the north remained largely agrarian. Because Christian missionaries were concentrated in the south, southerners also had access to Western education. Today, these regional differences persist: Literacy rates are significantly higher in the south than in the north, while poverty is more entrenched in the north than in the south.After independence, a succession of military governments held the two regions together, suppressing ethnic and religious differences and quelling dissent. Civilian rule returned in 1999, renewing hopes of a more equitable society. Instead, says Max Siollun, a Nigerian writer and historian, 1999 came and went, soldiers left and were replaced by civilians, but nothing changed. The government was still corrupt, poverty was still rife and economic opportunities and jobs were still scarce. Radical Islamic groups, Siollun says, filled this moral vacuum, as they often had in Nigeria.Boko Haram got its start in Maiduguri. In 2001, a young Muslim cleric named Mohammed Yusuf began preaching about the governments failures, blaming Western education for corrupting Nigerian leaders and advocating an Islamic society based on Shariah law. Yusufs message resonated with many in the north, especially its disaffected young men. Over the next two years, the group, then known as the Yusufiyya movement, tried to create independent settlements in Borno and in neighboring Yobe State. Most of the efforts began peacefully, though some cells were accused of killing clerics and police officers. Local news media began to use a term for the group, Boko Haram, which translates to Western education is forbidden in the regional language, Hausa. The insurgents official Arabic name, however, is jamaatu ahlis sunna liddaawati wal-jihad, which means People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophets Teachings and Jihad.In 2009, after the police opened fire on several Boko Haram members at a funeral procession in Maiduguri, shooting 17, the group bombed and set fire to government buildings. The police and the military battled the insurgents for days; more than 800 people were killed, most in extrajudicial killings by the military, and thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes. Yusuf was arrested and died in police custody. In response, Boko Haram staged an uprising. Under a newly appointed leader, Abubakar Shekau, the group burned down schools and police stations; blew up cellphone towers, markets, churches and mosques; and killed scores of students and teachers throughout central and northern Nigeria. Boko Haram has since massacred thousands of Nigerians and abducted hundreds more. In February, the group savagely murdered almost 60 schoolboys; some were burned alive. This year, Boko Haram set off three explosions in the countrys capital, underscoring that not even the federal government was safe from attack. In April, the group took the schoolgirls from Chibok. It still holds at least 200 of them captive.The Nigerian governments response to Boko Haram has been fraught from the beginning. President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner, has behaved as if the insurgency is a creation of northern Muslim leaders and thus their problem to solve. It took him more than three weeks to speak publicly about the abduction of the schoolgirls. His wife, Patience, provoked public outrage when she questioned whether the kidnapping had occurred, claiming it was all a ploy by her husbands opponents to embarrass him. (She later expressed concern over the missing schoolgirls.) Government critics charge that the military has been slow to respond to the threat posed by Boko Haram because officials are benefiting from the war in the north, siphoning money from the countrys $6 billion security budget.Residents in the northeast have complained frequently of the armys indifference. But their grievances coalesced around the response to the kidnapping of the girls. Local officials in Chibok say the army was alerted to the possibility of an attack up to four hours before the girls were abducted, but military reinforcements never arrived. Since then, the military has been criticized for not doing enough to look for the girls. It claimed that it had broken up a Boko Haram cell that participated in the kidnapping and that it was on the verge of rescuing the girls, but they never materialized. The United States and other foreign powers have offered assistance, but finding the girls remains a formidable task. Its a big, big challenge, says Stephen Schwartz, the director of Nigeria policy and operations at the State Department. If it were up to the United States, we would have difficulty trying to rescue that number of girls over that big an area. Its a really high-stakes kind of effort. I give the Nigerians a lot of credit for having the forbearance to not try anything premature or reckless. (The military declined repeated requests for comment.)Meanwhile, Boko Haram continues to fund and arm itself through bank robberies, extortion, ransom demands, sieges on Nigerian armed forces and, some analysts say, help from affiliates of Al Qaeda. In part, Boko Haram can operate with impunity because much of the northeast remains inaccessible, with bad roads and poor phone reception. Large areas along Nigerias borders with Cameroon, Chad and Niger are vulnerable to Boko Haram. The northern land mass is just huge, and some parts of it are not very hospitable, so the government hasnt always penetrated into every nook and cranny, Siollun says. Those border areas have always been bandit country; it facilitated the emergence of groups like Boko Haram.Despite Boko Harams increasing strength, the Nigerian government, says Campbell, the former ambassador, has not pursued a comprehensive anti-insurgency strategy. The government has done very little to address the pervasive sense of alienation among people in the north, Campbell says. If youre going to address the drivers of the insurgency, that takes time. My sense is implementation is very, very slow. Fatima Akilu, a director in Nigerias Office of the National Security Adviser, told me that a deradicalization program is being created to promote sports, literature and the arts to secular and Islamic schools, and that the government is working on an economic-development plan for the northeast. Akilu says officials also hope to devise safe passage for militants who wish to leave the group. She assured me that the Civilian J.T.F. was not a reaction to the militarys failures but rather a natural response on the part of northeasterners to a common threat  a kind of citizens brigade. It was a spontaneous movement that began without any involvement from the state at all, she says. These were youths who said, We no longer want you in our communities, and they pushed them out. It is an initiative we support.From the time Kalli wakes up, around 4:30 in the morning, until he goes to bed, sometimes as late as 2:30 a.m., he receives calls alerting him to Boko Haram sightings, impending or developing attacks and recent abductions and killings. When he hears of a village under siege, he rounds up as many of his boys as he can and heads out to the fight  without protective gear and at times without proper weapons. Sometimes your gun wont even work, he lamented. It was a miracle that only 15 of his men had been killed so far. God is with us, he said. When he began this work, his children, whom he calls my soldiers, and his wives urged him to reconsider. I dont have enough time to get rest or sleep, he said. I am always engaged. Kalli, a Muslim, says he is ready to die for his religion and his country. These insurgents came to destroy the image of Islam, he told me. They are cult members. Islam doesnt allow anybody to kill anybody, either Muslim or Christian. I want to protect the integrity of this country. He is still employed by the auditors office, but was given an extended leave for this new public service.When I first met Kalli at the hotel in Maiduguri, he was with three men who had been seized by Boko Haram. The group has turned to forcible recruitment as its violent tactics erode support among northerners. They began to recruit by force, because they have moved so far from their core ideology, Akilu says. When Shekau descended into this indiscriminate slaughter, murdering people for no reason, a lot of people didnt understand what was going on and did not subscribe to the philosophy of the current leadership. Sometimes Boko Haram compels the boys and young men it captures to spy or fight for the group; sometimes it kills those it captures, a warning to anyone who would collaborate with government forces. The men with Kalli managed to escape. (This is not unheard of; Boko Haram does not always guard its captives carefully. Right after their abduction, some 50 of the Chibok schoolgirls also managed to get away. One of them, a 14-year-old named Rejoice Yaga, told me that the militants seemed confused and kept asking one another if they should take the girls or leave them.)Kalli had already debriefed the men, but he wanted me to hear their stories firsthand. The first man I spoke to, Ali Bukar, a tall 40-year-old whose face bears the distinctive scars of his Kanuri ethnic group, was abducted in May while farming outside his home in Konduga, a village in Borno State about 20 miles from Maiduguri. I had heard people talk about Boko Haram, but I had never seen them until the day they came and captured me, he said. His wife and children were inside the house, unaware that just a few yards away two gunmen were tying him up with rope. The militants placed Bukar between them on their motorcycle and drove off. He thought he was doomed. I asked them what kind of offense I committed, but they refused to talk to me.It took less than an hour to reach the site where Boko Haram had set up camp. Several men, some in T-shirts, others in traditional dress, milled about. They threw him, still tied up, to one side. Over the next three days, the men debated whether to kill him, occasionally feeding him beans and discussing plans to attack Maiduguri. But his rope was loose, and one day after nightfall with his hands still tied behind his back, he escaped. He ran for nearly 12 hours through the bush to reach his village. When we met, his arms were still severely bruised, marked by puffy, raw lesions; he could barely raise them. I will never go back to that village, he said of his hometown, shaking his head slowly. He has since moved some relatives with him to Maiduguri.The second man Kalli introduced me to, Hamza Alhaji, was more fortunate. A prematurely graying 30-year-old who made his living collecting firewood in the forest outside Maiduguri, he was ambushed by Boko Haram militants while driving back to the city last spring and then unexpectedly abandoned when they retreated into the bush.As I spoke with Bukar and Alhaji, Kalli kept interrupting, eager to answer the questions himself; he knew their stories so well. For Kalli, the men were proof that Boko Haram must be stopped at all costs. How could anyone be safe when grown men were seized in the middle of the afternoon?Unlike Alhaji and Bukar, the third man with Kalli that day  Modu Jalomi, a 35-year-old who lives in Yajiwa, a town 45 miles outside Maiduguri  was used to seeing Boko Haram members near his home. I have seen them before, he said. I know some of their members. The militants occasionally passed through Yajiwa to buy food. At first, residents welcomed Boko Haram; as recently as last year, young men were voluntarily joining the militants. It was their own wish, because of religion, Jalomi said. He could count 20 young men, most of them teenagers, who left. He pitied them now, he said, because the situation had changed. When people saw that what Boko Haram is doing is not the right thing, they started to run away, Jalomi said.As Jalomi lay in bed next to his wife one night, four men came into the house with AK-47s. One was his neighbor. They didnt even hide their faces, Jalomi recalled. They took him on a motorcycle to the same area near Alagarno where they had taken Bukar and accused him of feeding information about them to the Civilian J.T.F. and the military. Jalomi was tied to a mango tree for 11 hours before he managed to break free. The militants shot at him as he fled. He now lives in Maiduguri and hasnt returned to his village since. They have no support now, he said of Boko Haram.In a residential area of Maiduguri, Kalli rented a small office from which he directed his unit. When I visited, bags and boxes of donated items for victims of Boko Haram took up half the room. When we started this, everybody was chasing the insurgents, Kalli said, recalling the chaos of the early days of fighting Boko Haram. Later on, we decided to organize and divide into 10 sectors. Splitting up the city this way allowed him and his fellow commanders to more effectively monitor different neighborhoods. The Civilian J.T.F. has always relied on residents for tips about insurgents who may be hiding among them. Most readily complied, but as the Civilian J.T.F. gains strength, residents are beginning to fear that the vigilantes are using their power not to fight Boko Haram but to intimidate personal enemies. Men and boys have reported being forced to join the group under threat of being beaten. The Civilian J.T.F., some say, could one day prove to be as dangerous as the insurgents.The Civilian J.T.F. works closely with Nigerias Joint Task Force  the military, the police and other security forces  which has been accused of indiscriminate killings in the counterinsurgency. After a March attack by Boko Haram on Giwa Barracks, a military garrison, troops killed hundreds of people, most of whom were unarmed suspects held there. In Maiduguri, thousands of boys and men have been detained on little to no evidence. Some are taken to Giwa Barracks, from which reports of torture and extrajudicial killings regularly emerge. Others simply disappear; sometimes their bodies turn up at the citys morgues. In response, residents barricade streets with logs and tires to keep outsiders away. There are entire sections of the city that government officials are afraid to enter for fear of reprisal.In August, Amnesty International released footage showing what appear to be Nigerian soldiers and Civilian J.T.F. members near Maiduguri, cutting the throats of suspected Boko Haram members and then pushing them into an open grave. Amnesty International also says the vigilantes have made arbitrary arrests and engaged in torture and extrajudicial killings of suspects, both independently and with the military. From witnesses and victims and families of victims that we have talked to, there is an undeniable degree of frustration and concern and fear against the vigilante groups, Netsanet Belay, the Africa director of research and advocacy at Amnesty International, told me. We are seeing the Civilian Joint Task Force increasingly engaged in serious, mass human-rights violations. Schwartz, the State Departments Nigeria director, says the United States has pressed and continues to press the Nigerian military on human rights  Giwa Barracks was a big issue of contention. The problem with vigilante groups like the Civilian J.T.F., he adds, is that they are essentially unaccountable. Theyre not trained as a law-enforcement group, theyre not underpinned by a law of the land, he says. We dont sanction or condone lawless actions of vigilante groups. Ive seen a number of these videos, and its disturbing.Government officials in Borno State express few misgivings about the Civilian J.T.F. One official in the governors office, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told me that the Civilian J.T.F. was doing commendable work identifying and arresting Boko Haram members, and that any abuses committed were most likely the fault of the military on joint exercises. The states governor, Shettima, describes the emergence of the Civilian J.T.F. as almost a divine intervention, though he acknowledges that one may not rule out some infractions from some overzealous members. The government, in conjunction with the military, he says, is working to rein in excesses through a training program, the Borno Youth Empowerment Scheme, which began in 2013 and provides a modest monthly stipend. The plan is to train at least 5,000 Civilian J.T.F. members by the end of this year; so far, 3,000 men have begun the program.Jacob Zenn, an analyst of African affairs at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, argues that to survive, the Civilian J.T.F. has had to evolve from stick-wielding vigilantes to a more sophisticated group. Its a catch-22, because if they remain lightly armed, they are at high risk of being massacred by heavily armed Boko Haram insurgents, Zenn says. But if they are armed, they essentially become like soldiers. Once they assume their militarized roles, they may become what soldiers are in the region: both protection and threat.In his office, Kalli insisted that anyone who fears the Civilian J.T.F. must have a relationship with Boko Haram. Any good Samaritans will have to support the Civilian J.T.F., because we have done a lot to bring peace to this city, he said. If his neighbors refuse to understand that he is trying to help them, he will make them understand. Last year, he turned in his 18-year-old nephew, whom he believed to be a member of Boko Haram. He later watched the military execute him. Kalli expressed no remorse. I saw him with AK-47s, so that proves hes a Boko Haram member, he said. When the insurgency began in 2009, his nephew attended Boko Harams sermons, and that year he ran away from Maiduguri. His family and neighbors suspected he had joined the group. I was the first person to see him when he came back to town, Kalli said. He was part of my family, part of my blood. But I apprehended him and handed him over to security. He told his brother and sister-in-law that their son confessed to killing more than 30 people and even threatened to kill him. I asked him, Is this the way we brought you up?  Kalli recalled. You know, the first thing before you start this job, you will take an oath. The oath is that you will not hide anybody, whether its your friend or relative. Couldnt his nephew have been brainwashed? I asked. He was, after all, little more than a child. Kallis face contorted into an expression somewhere between anger and disbelief, and his voice took on a hard edge. Whether he understood or he didnt understand, his mind was polluted, he replied. We have no regret for anybody if you are a Boko Haram member, because we have suffered a lot at the hands of Boko Haram. We have lost so many people.Several young men marched into Kallis office, greeting him with reverence before sitting down to wait for their training stipends. Among them was Mohammed Musa, an electrical-engineering student at the University of Maiduguri who signed up with the Civilian J.T.F. last year. For many young men, joining the Civilian J.T.F. is a way of retaking power after so much has been lost  relatives, friends, a viable future. His parents are happy that he volunteers, but he recognizes that much of Maiduguri is wary of the civilian police. Many people fear us, he said with frustration. They say, See this Civilian J.T.F., theyre doing bad things. They act as if were useless or up to no good. They should be praying for us every day.Kallis son Lawan, a small-boned and polite 17-year-old in his last year of high school, entered his fathers office and slid into a chair. He described how he inspects cars at checkpoints and carries a knife for protection. One charge leveled against the Civilian J.T.F. is that it recruits children. Human Rights Watch reports indicate that some vigilantes manning checkpoints in Maiduguri appear to be younger than 18. The watchdog group says witnesses have seen children working at checkpoints in Borno and Yobe States. If you are not 18, you are not part of us  that is the truth, Kalli said. His son was different, he said; he wasnt allowed to use a gun. We are not using any children. If we see any under-age ones on the streets, we arrest them and call their parents. I asked him about worries that the vigilantes could be committing abuses. He again became defensive. We dont kill anybody. We hand them to the authorities. We have to protect ourselves, but we normally catch them alive.One afternoon, Kalli picked me up in one of his trucks. A new crop of volunteers was jammed into the back. They wore T-shirts and sunglasses, with handkerchiefs and guns slung around their necks. They were talking and laughing loudly and watched with amusement as I climbed into the vehicle.I was sitting in my office preparing paperwork for my boys who went for training when I received a call from one of my chairmen, Kalli said as he drove. He told me that hed been told that some members of Boko Haram we were looking for were in town and that hed seen them at Ecobank. When we rushed there, they had already finished their transaction and left. I drove my boys to the car park and mounted a checkpoint. I left some of them there so that they can maybe trap them.He put on the trucks siren and swerved through narrow spaces between lanes. As we sped through Civilian J.T.F. checkpoints, the young men at the barriers saluted him. We are suspecting that they might enter the market to buy food items, he said of the Boko Haram members he was tracking. So we have already put our members on alert. They sleep in the bush, come in to get money and food items and then go back. But we have our people watching them. If we see them, we will grab them.I asked him about the guns his crew was carrying. They looked like relics from the 19th century, short-barreled rifle-muskets with wooden grips. I personally told my boys to carry guns, he said. Residents donated money to help buy the weapons, he said; at first they had only cutlasses and sticks to fight militants armed with antiaircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades. I bought these local guns you have been seeing and distributed them, because my area is the worst area. His zone, he pointed out, covers up to Sambisa and the outskirts of Maiduguri. Anything can come through us, he said. The siren blared louder.As we drove, Kalli returned to talking about the military: They are not responding the way they should; that is the biggest problem we are facing. It is the fault of senior officers. If I were a soldier, I would not go in, because I wouldnt have enough equipment to fight the insurgents! I withdrew my men from Sambisa because I knew the authorities didnt want to finish this job.We zigzagged through traffic to pick up medicine for Kallis youngest daughter, who was gravely ill with the measles. His phone rang; the caller was reporting yet another attack on a village, demanding to know why Kalli and his men werent there. When he hung up, he sighed, and his body slackened. You know, Im tired of this thing, he said. We gave the security forces everything  information about the camps, where they are, and theyre not doing anything. I asked him if he has given up on finding the girls. We cant go up to Chibok again, he said.The path that Kalli and his unit took out of Maiduguri to Chibok in May is now a lonely one. When I traveled along the same road on a market day, only a few cars, trucks and minivan taxis hurtled past torched vehicles and the burned-out shells of schools and homes. Boys rode bikes with bows and arrows tucked under their arms. Commuters between the two towns were stopped at a series of checkpoints, some manned by the military and others by the Civilian J.T.F. The vigilantes were more disorganized but savvier. They casually waved machetes at drivers and demanded that they turn on their windshield wipers. Militants had been hiding weapons under car hoods, which prevented the wipers from working.I spoke with Kalli shortly after I left Maiduguri. He was in low spirits. His daughter with the measles had died, and he had taken a break from his Civilian J.T.F. duties. I asked him when he would rejoin his colleagues. I dont know, he said. I need rest.In July, a bomb blast in a Maiduguri market killed at least 20 people. This fall, Boko Haram occupied numerous northeastern towns, including Bama, only 45 miles from Maiduguri, and declared a caliphate. The government recently claimed to have struck a cease-fire with Boko Haram that would lead to the release of the remaining Chibok schoolgirls. But in October, the militants abducted 60 women and girls from Adamawa State and later at least 30 boys and girls from Borno State, casting doubt on the existence of a truce.Yet when I called Kalli recently, he spoke of the future as bright. He said the military was holding on to Maiduguri and had pushed Boko Haram out of other places. He was no longer doing much fieldwork. He was now an executive at the state level for the Civilian J.T.F., coordinating the sectors and managing their finances. He was also running for Senate. Kalli remained relentlessly upbeat. We are 100 percent sure we will kill these insurgents, he told me. He seemed to believe it.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-06T02:22:59Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/09/magazine/09BokoHaram1/mag-09BokoHaram-t_CA0-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 5232}, {"title": "Ottawa shootings: Timeline of events", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29733735", "text": "A timeline of the events on Wednesday as Canada's capital witnessed multiple shootings that resulted in the death of a soldier and a suspected gunman.

Many senior American officials fear that the result could be inconclusive, producing a vague statement of principles and another extension.That process could drag on, they fear, lead the Iranians to resume some fuel production they have halted, encourage the Saudis to begin enrichment of their own and perhaps revive Israeli threats to take military action.But a collapse would also be likely to mean Iranians would see no further sanctions relief  and perhaps new sanctions from the new Republican Congress. My fear is that the Iranians will see the new Senate as a sign that the president is weak, and that he wouldnt be able to get sanctions lifted, said one European negotiator dealing with the Iranians, who would not speak on the record because of the delicacy of the talks.Mr. Obamas letter was worded generally; it did not get into specific negotiating points. But it appeared intended to drive home to the hard-liners in the Iranian leadership that the elements now under negotiation offered Iran a way to sign a deal and still be left with a small nuclear enrichment capability. Those elements include an informal agreement with Russia to convert Irans low-enriched uranium into reactor fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power plant, Irans only commercial nuclear reactorBut Ayatollah Khamenei has not backed away from his demand that in seven years or so Iran would begin a tenfold increase in its nuclear enrichment capability. That would reduce its breakout time, the time required to make one bombs worth of highly enriched uranium, to weeks.Iran has lived up to all of the provisions of a temporary agreement with the West it signed a year ago. But a report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday confirmed that it has thwarted inspectors seeking information about suspected experiments and designs that would point to a military use of its nuclear program.The report indicated that Iran is producing low-enriched uranium steadily but slowly. Its current stocks of reactor-grade fuel, if converted into highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium, would be enough to produce more than a half-dozen weapons. It is unclear how much of that fuel will be shipped to Russia if the current negotiations are successful.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:05:01Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5404}, {"title": "Why Kobani could be an opportunity for Turkey, Kurds", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/29/opinion/kobani-opportunity-turkey-kurds-u-s-/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Gnl Tol is the founding director of The Middle East Institute's Center for Turkish Studies and an adjunct professor at George Washington University's Institute for Middle East Studies. The views expressed in this commentary are entirely those of the author.(CNN) -- In the space of just 48 hours last week, Turkey went from calling the PYD -- the Kurds defending the Syrian border town of Kobani -- a terrorist group to opening up an arms corridor from Iraq to aid its fight against ISIS.That dramatic change in policy, along with growing collaboration between the United States and the PYD (the armed wing of the Democratic Union Party), could tip a month-long battle against ISIS militants in favor of the Kurds.It could also, finally, pave the way for a resolution between Turkey and the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state. This would remove a major irritant in the coalition's strategy in Syria.Turkish leaders in Ankara resisted domestic and international pressure to aid the PYD for a month while Kobani became the focal point of the operation against ISIS. Turkey's Kurds took to the streets to demonstrate against what they saw as the government's refusal to protect their kin next door.In reaction to President Erdogan's indifference to the prospect of the massacre of Kurds at the hands of the Islamic State, the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said that if the town fell he would end the peace negotiations with Ankara that have been in progress since 2012.With help arriving from the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga and the United States, the prospect of losing Kobani is no longer imminent. The Turkish government can breathe a sigh of relief, but not for long.Washington's decision to help the PYD militarily marks the emergence of a new alliance at a time when Turkey has already been unnerved by the recent diplomatic boost the group has received in the West.In response to the growing Islamic State threat, the PKK, the Peshmerga, and the PYD have established a united Kurdish front, with the PYD militants coming to the aid of Peshmerga fighters and halting the jihadi group's advance into the autonomous region of northern Iraq.PYD forces helped thousands of Yazidis escape from the western part of the region as ISIS attacked, making the group the West's best hope for on-the-ground troops and winning it positive reviews in the Western media.Since the PKK started its assault against the Islamic State in northern Iraq, there has been a lot of talk in Western capitals about removing it from the terror list. The U.S. move to openly ally with the PYD only adds to Turkey's fears.But if Turkey's leaders manage to look beyond their long-running Kurdish phobia, they could turn the PYD-U.S. dialogue to their advantage.The PKK, with its new international legitimacy and the alliance the United States forged with its Syrian offshoot, is unlikely to put these gains at risk by resuming violence against Turkey.For Turkey, the Kurdish issue is more than a domestic security problem; its concern over Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria has diminished its room for maneuver and has kept it from playing an effective role both in the anti-Assad and the anti-Islamic State coalition.Turkey has already been marginalized in regional affairs due to other foreign policy miscalculations, and it cannot afford to miss out on a seat at the table on Syria because of its reservations about the PYD.Turkey shares a long border with Syria, hosts 1.6 million Syrian refugees, and has historical ties to Syria's ethnic and sectarian communities. Home to well-established Salafi networks, Turkey is one of the countries most vulnerable to attacks by the Islamic State. It is thus in Ankara's interest to treat the peace process with the PKK more urgently so that it can attend to these pressing matters.Nevertheless, Turkey's policies still prioritize undercutting the Kurds over any other concern. Its policies are largely to blame for the Syrian Kurds' failure to join the Western backed Syrian opposition, and it has been dragging its feet to join the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State because it views ISIS as an effective fighting force not just against the Assad regime, but also against the PYD.A U.S.-PYD-Turkish partnership, however, could work toward the removal of the Assad regime, which Ankara says is its top priority in Syria. Turkey has criticized the U.S.-led coalition for prioritizing the removal of ISIS without addressing the root cause of the problem: the regime in Damascus. The United States, however, could engage the PYD in pursuing both objectives.With the right push from Washington and Ankara, the Syrian Kurds, with their secular bent and effective fighting force, could become part of the ground force that the West so desperately needs in Syria.The United States has taken a positive step in reconsidering its approach vis--vis the PYD. At a time when the lingering Kurdish issue has caused Turkey to become marginalized in the fight against ISIS, both the PKK and Ankara would be well-served if they took steps to advance the stalled peace process.Let's hope the U.S. and Turkish decisions to help the PYD are more than tactical moves.

In September, he laid out a limited military engagement against ISIS with a pledge that it would not involve American troops fighting on the ground.U.S. officials insist the troops are in a non combat role, but with the additional troop numbers there will be some 3,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq - on the ground and in harm's way.In interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, Democratic Congressman John Garamendi, who is also a member of the House Armed Services Committee says Congress was informed about the additional troop deployment.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:23:08Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141107205334-exp-erin-intv-garamendi-obama-sends-troops-to-iraq-00002123-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 5653}, {"title": "ISIS: From guerrillas to conquerors", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/17/opinion/bronk-isis-guerillas/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Justin Bronk is a research analyst in the military sciences program at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- It is a question that the global community is seeking to understand as the crisis in Iraq and Syria deepens. How can such a numerically small force as ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, have taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, and how can it hold the ground taken while simultaneously conducting multiple offensive actions in both countries?The most recent CIA estimate in September 2014 put the total number of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria at between 20,000 and 31,500. But such numbers, while alarming, are not nearly enough to explain the stunning military successes the group has enjoyed.ISIS is at heart a guerrilla army that has recently captured large stocks of modern and heavy weaponry.While the equipment that makes headlines is war planes, captured tanks, heavy artillery and American-made Humvees, most ISIS fighters are still armed with the same mix of Soviet-era small arms and American M16/M4 pattern rifles that their Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian opponents rely on.Much of the heavy equipment ISIS has at its disposal was captured during their lightning advance into Iraq, not before. It is not the core reason for their battlefield successes. However, what it does do is make planning any battle against ISIS forces an uncertain exercise because one may have to face weapons and vehicles from right across the capability spectrum.When it comes to offensives against prepared positions, ISIS forces can certainly deploy heavy artillery, modern weapons and tanks that give it greatly enhanced capabilities and completely outgun Kurdish Peshmerga forces in particular. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that ISIS even deployed a captured M1A1 Abrams in its takeover of the Mosul Dam, before eventually being driven back by repeated U.S. airstrikes.This is where airpower can make a difference since heavy artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles are vulnerable to airstrikes when concentrated in the open such as at the Mosul Dam and in the current offensive to take Kobani.What air power cannot do is easily degrade or neutralize ISIS's core advantages which are strong battlefield leadership, significant tactical autonomy and aggressive tactics. Their battlefield tactics are somewhat reminiscent of the German Blitzkrieg campaigns in the early part of World War II. They use fast, well-coordinated forces with vehicle support to attack enemy weak points in strength under the cover of long range artillery and mortar fire.A particular speciality is outflanking defensive positions and then mopping up defenders who attempt to retreat. The tactic is as much psychological as it is kinetic, and is greatly magnified by the horrendous and public brutality ISIS has systematically exhibited wherever it has gained control.Even well-motivated and equipped troops are likely to contemplate tactical withdrawals if outflanked and in danger of being surrounded by an unknown number of fanatical mass murderers with apparently superior weaponry and tactics. Where, as in Mosul, the defenders are poorly motivated, even small ISIS attacks are capable of provoking mass panic and routs.Kobani is an unusual operation for ISIS fighters in some respects, in that they appear committed to what has become a pitched battle in the open where they are vulnerable to airstrikes. Despite having surrounded Kobani and conducting aggressive and apparently well-coordinated infiltration attempts from multiple approaches, the sort of street-to-street 'meat grinder' that Kobani has become does not play to ISIS's strengths.Against an enemy with nowhere to retreat to and air support, a numerically limited force such as ISIS that normally relies as much on psychological effects as firepower to take ground faces a tough challenge. This is just as well since on the ground, it is only the bravery of lightly armed Kurdish fighters standing between ISIS and control of the town. Airstrikes are essential but could not keep ISIS out of the town alone.In terms of defending the ground it has, ISIS appears to be efficient at quickly moving forces in strength to meet particular Iraqi and Peshmerga offensives. However, along most of the 'frontlines' across Northern Iraq and Syria, a relatively small number of ISIS forces appear capable of pinning potential attackers in their defensive lines with a combination of reputation and sporadic mortar, sniper and machine-gun fire.Given the disorganized state of the ground forces arrayed against them, and the limitations of airpower for rolling back such an enemy, this may well be enough to allow ISIS to maintain control of most of its newly declared Caliphate for a long while yet.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T03:59:56Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140822024648-isis-fighters-2-story-top.jpg", "id": 1593}, {"title": "Jerusalem car 'attack' kills baby at rail station", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29725278", "text": "A three-month-old girl was killed and eight other people were injured when a car hit them at a Jerusalem tram stop.Police say the driver was a Palestinian from East Jerusalem.

If what has been delivered can make a measurable difference then they cant win. They will need to recalibrate their commitment.The state of the battlefield is now markedly different than late last week, before the increase in strikes, when Isis forces were advancing despite the presence of US and coalition jets and seemed poised to overrun Kobani, the fourth-largest Kurdish town in Syria.Such a victory would have been a significant boost for Isis, proving it could prevail over the US and its Arab partners as it continued on its rampage through the centre of the region.The jihadis gains had been made while Turkey refused to support the fighters inside Kobani, because of their links to the PKK, which has been fighting an insurgency against the Turkish government for nearly 40 years.Kurdish fighters contacted by the Guardian say the weapons drops have boosted morale and, if continued, will help them hold back the Isis onslaught.The weapons arent enough to change the game in one night, said Sores Hassan, a spokesman for the YPG militia, which is fighting in Kobani. But if the aid is continued, it will help us a lot. This support is helping us morally and lifting our spirits more than really helping us on the ground. We are talking to the coalition through different channels to continue the support and we hope it will happen more often.Another fighter, who identified himself as Ameen, said: The game has changed now. After the Americans provided us with weapons, we turned from defending the city to attacking Isis. Now we are no longer playing the defensive in this war. I believe the next couple of days will bring us victory.In the first week of the air strikes, the Americans were bombing empty Isis headquarters. Now, it is different. They are more accurate and they know the right places to bomb.Mahmoud Haji Omar, a member of the peshmerga committee in the Kurdistan parliament, confirmed that peshmerga troops were preparing to deploy to Kobani: We are planning to send a number of peshmerga forces to go and fight in Kobani against (Isis). We are currently selecting the fighters that will be going to Kobani. Turkey has agreed to give passage as long as the peshmerga fighters bring back the weapons that they take in to Kobani.Earlier, US secretary of state John Kerry said the Obama administration decided to airdrop weapons and ammunitions to valiant Kurds because it would be irresponsible and morally very difficult not to support them.Kerry told reporters in the Indonesian capital Jakarta that the US administration understood Turkeys concerns about supplying the Kurds, but said the situation is such in Kobani that the resupplies were deemed absolutely necessary in a crisis moment.Let me say very respectfully to our allies the Turks that we understand fully the fundamentals of their opposition and ours to any kind of terrorist group and particularly obviously the challenges they face with respect [to] the PKK, Kerry said. But we have undertaken a coalition effort to degrade and destroy Isil [Isis], and it is presenting itself in major numbers in this place called Kobani.Turkish foreign minister Mevlt avusolu said that the decision to allow the peshmerga to pass through its territory was in line with a wider regional effort to fend off Isis.We want the region to be cleared of all threats. We assess the military and medical materials aid provided by our Iraqi Kurdish brothers and airdropped by the United States to all forces defending Kobani in this framework, he said. There are seven or eight groups that are fighting together with the PYD [the Democratic Union party] [in Syria].Some observers pointed out that the perceived policy shift in Ankara was no surprise and pointed to a string of violent protests that shook Turkey two weeks ago in response to the governments perceived inaction over the crisis in Kobani.Nevertheless, it underscores a bewildering array of allegiances: Turkey last week bombed PKK positions inside its borders, and is days later preparing to aid the PYD, which it says is a direct PKK ally.Mesut Yegen, a historian of the Kurdish issue, said that Turkey could not risk the fall of Kobani: The events from two weeks ago clearly showed that if Kobani should fall, the peace process would end. The Turkish government wanted to test how people would react, and they saw what would have happened.

It was unclear whether he was killed.After the strikes in September, American officials expressed optimism that the missile barrage had killed at least some of Khorasans leaders, including Mr. Fadhli. Some jihadist sympathizers hailed him on social media as a martyr.But in recent weeks, as intelligence analysts sifted through field reports and communications intercepts, they grew more certain that senior members of the group had survived.The Khorasan group, we still believe, remains a dangerous entity, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters this week. He declined to comment on the status of Khorasans leadership.In a statement after Thursdays strike, the United States Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, said that five sites had been hit and that initial reports indicated that they had succeeded in destroying or severely damaging several Khorasan group vehicles and buildings assessed to be meeting and staging areas, I.E.D.-making facilities and training facilities.The statement did not mention the targeting of any individuals.Syrian activists also reported the strikes, saying that they had killed at least two children and an unknown number of fighters.One hit a car belonging to the Nusra Front in the village of Sarmada. The activists did not say who had been in it.Other strikes hit facilities belonging to the Nusra Front in the town of Harim, reducing them to rubble, and a base belonging to another Islamist rebel group, Ahrar al-Sham, near a border crossing with Turkey. In statements and photos posted online, Ahrar al-Sham and the Nusra Front acknowledged that their bases had been hit, and the Nusra Front released photos on Twitter that it said showed dead civilians.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an antigovernment monitoring group, said that two young girls had been killed in the strike on Harim and that six members of the Nusra Front had been killed in another strike in Aleppo Province farther east. Another activist, who gave his name as Ibrahim al-Idlibi, said seven civilians had been killed in addition to a number of fighters from Ahrar al-Sham.A spokesman for the Department of Defense, Col. Steven H. Warren, said that Syria was an extremely complex operating environment and that the United States took precautions to prevent civilian casualties.Many in the Syrian opposition have expressed skepticism about the existence of the Khorasan group, saying that the United States had created it to justify strikes on Islamist rebels. Some also defend the Nusra Front, calling it a loyal ally in the fight against President Bashar al-Assad.All the strikes on Tuesday occurred in the ungoverned strip of land along the Turkish border, where many rebel groups have bases and frequently go to Turkey to buy supplies and to take a break from the war. Membership in many of these groups is fluid, with fighters flowing among them based on who has arms and money.The United States has been providing limited arms support to a small number of rebel groups deemed to be moderates, and a larger effort to train 5,000 rebels a year to fight the Islamic State is in the planning stages.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:02:45Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/07/world/07syria/07syria-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "id": 5310}, {"title": "Day in pictures: 21 October", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-29705297", "text": "Our selection of some of the best news photographs taken around the world during the past 24 hours.Fans take selfies with the new wax figure of Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch at Madame Tussauds in London, England.South African athlete Oscar Pistorius is led from the court in Pretoria, South Africa, having been given a five-year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said Tuesday. 'The secretary-general reiterates his call for an end to use of these indiscriminate weapons and the importance of a world free of cluster bombs.'Cluster munitions are rockets or bombs that hold dozens or hundreds of smaller bombs inside and are designed to discharge over a wide area when they hit the ground, according to HRW. The dispersal area of the armaments inside is often the size of a football field and puts both combatants and civilians at risk.The rockets that do not explode remain active and are a 'life-threatening hazard for civilians long after conflict,' the U.N. website says.Ukraine's envoy at the United Nations denounced such reports.The Ukrainian army 'has never used cluster munition at the ATO (antiterrorist operation) area in the Eastern Ukraine,' Yuriy Sergeyev, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Nations tweeted Tuesday, citing the official Ministry of Defense statement.Investigators surveyed more than a dozen urban and rural locations during a weeklong trip in October during which they looked at dispersal of munitions and documented the unopened, malfunctioned bombs, according to the report.'Witnesses also told us what it sounded like when the attack happened, that it was multiple smaller explosions which is typical of a cluster munitions attack, instead of single, larger ones,' said Ole Solvang, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.The report added that though there is no conclusive evidence, it is likely that anti-government forces are also responsible for cluster munitions attacks.'I think it is also an occasion to reiterate the (U.N. secretary-general's) call for a political solution for the current crisis in Ukraine,' said Dujarric.In recent months, the United States and the European Union have placed sanctions against Russia over its 'illegal actions in Ukraine,' Obama said in September.Kiev and the West accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of arming and supporting the pro-Russia rebels, and of sending Russian troops into Ukraine over recent months.In 2008, over 100 countries in the United Nations signed on to ban cluster bombs, according to the U.N. website.

Even the Israeli prime minister has compared their relationship to that of a bickering 'old couple.'The latest example of their dysfunctional marriage emerged Tuesday when a senior Obama administration official was quoted calling the Israeli leader a 'chickens**t' who doesn't match war talk with action. The unnamed official, speaking to Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, was only saying in public what key Obama aides have been muttering privately for years.'You have a dysfunctional relationship between Netanyahu and Obama,' said Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator.A senior official with a prominent pro-Israel policy organization in Washington said : 'These guys don't like each other, they don't pretend to like each other.'Netanyahu offered a pointed response to the Goldberg article, saying he's 'not prepared to make concessions that endanger our state.'The relationship is troubled on multiple fronts. Goldberg also reported that the Israeli leader had 'written off' the White House, an insult to an administration that still has two years in office. And tensions flared last week when the White House denied Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon meetings with Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry.The administration tried to contain the fallout from Goldberg's story on Wednesday. Alistair Baskey, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Obama and Netanyahu have 'forged an effective partnership, and consult closely and frequently.'Still, irritants have long tested the alliance between Washington and the Jewish state  over peace talks, wars in Lebanon and Gaza, settlements and Israeli military action in places like Iraq and Syria.But the dislike between Netanyahu and Obama is particularly acute -- and personal. Goldberg lists a stunning string of insults he has heard officials fire off at Netanyahu over the years, including 'recalcitrant, myopic, reactionary, obtuse, blustering, pompous and 'Aspergery.''The Netanyahu-Obama relationship has played out in a series of awkward photo-ops, anonymous quotes in US and Israeli media and tense body language. White House officials were apoplectic in 2011 when Netanyahu lectured Obama in the Oval Office about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to 'illusions.'The same year, Obama was caught on an open mic, telling then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy: 'You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day.'The White House, for all its official praise for the 'unshakeable bonds' between the U.S. and Israel, blames what it sees as Netanyahu's intransigence over Jewish settlement policy and his playing to a domestic political gallery for the collapse of John Kerry's peace drive with the Palestinians.Key officials fumed at Netanyahu's open backing for Republican Mitt Romney during Obama's re-election campaign and over what they see as interference in American politics through his strong ties to hawks in Congress.But the roots of the animosity lie deeper  in sharply differing perceptions of the threat posed by Iran  an issue coming to a head with a deadline looming for a deal between Tehran and world powers next month.For Obama, the Iranian nuclear challenge is another crisis to be managed, and a test case of his doctrine that the United States should be prepared to talk to its enemies. But people familiar with Netanyahu's worldview say he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the Jewish state from an existential threat posed by Tehran's nuclear ambitions.Israel worries that the agreement that emerges will leave Iran as a nuclear 'threshold state' with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon.'I fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen,' Netanyahu told Obama in a White House photo-op this month.The Obama administration says the kind of 'perfect' deal envisioned by Israel, which would strip Iran of centrifuges and nuclear infrastructure is not realistic, and says its goal is to ensure that Tehran does not have a nuclear bomb.The disagreement is likely to provoke a new political showdown over Iran in Congress, where a bipartisan coalition is mulling a number of steps including further sanctions which the White House warns could scupper a deal and lead to war.While the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu deteriorates, it does not so far appear to be harming the fundamental relationship between their two nations.That has not always been the case in the past.In 1981, the Reagan administration instructed U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to back a resolution criticizing Israel for an air attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor.Relations became so frayed between President George H.W. Bush and the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that his secretary of state, James Baker, told lawmakers that if Israel wanted to talk peace, it should call the White House switchboard.Personal relations may be fraught now with Netanyahu, but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military U.S. aid to Israel which amounts to $3 billion a year.Indeed, the Obama administration asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the Iron Dome anti-missile system which shielded Israel from Hamas rockets during the latest Gaza war this summer. Senior officials from both sides also say privately that the security relationship between the allies has never been better.Miller said that Obama's spats with Netanyahu will cause hurt feelings.'But what do they amount to? It is confined and contained to a soap opera-like exchange that never leads to anything of consequence,' he said.What this latest soap opera may amount to for the White House is an unwelcome new political row with Congress over its Israel policy  just as it is gearing up for a fight over Iran.'When the president discusses Israel and Iran, it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is America's friend and who he thinks is America's enemy,' House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a bit rich to get a lecture by Boehner on 'salty language.' He insisted that the remarks by the official about Netanyahu did not represent the view of the administration but pledged to continue to air differences with Israel on 'illegitimate' building.That will all but ensure another bitter spat with Netanyahu soon.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T23:00:56Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141030074602-nd-dnt-labott-official-mocks-netanyahu-00004906-story-top.jpg", "id": 4325}, {"title": "Pakistan sheltered Laden and now blames India of aggression: MEA's jibe at Islamabad", "url": "http://ibnlive.in.com/news/pakistan-sheltered-laden-and-now-blames-india-of-aggression-meas-jibe-at-islamabad/505243-3.html", "text": "New Delhi: India on Friday took a potshot at Pakistan over the continuous ceasefire violations and the latter's allegation that India was the aggressor country.

Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing.A few days earlier, the militants bombed a bus station, killing at least 71 people on the outskirts of the capital of Abuja.'When I heard the news, I started crying,' Ayuba said. 'I said to myself, 'What's wrong with these people?''In his case, the car wash bombing was not his first brush with the militants.Years before that, members of the terror group ambushed his father, a police officer, and sprayed his car with bullets.'When my father arrived ... they came out, one of them shot him' in the head, he said. His father died.The lawless Borno state, whose capital is Maiduguri, is a major hot spot for the militants. So much so, it had banned motorbikes a few years ago to prevent drive-by attacks by Boko Haram.The group is known to use gunmen on motorbikes to kill.For nearly a year, Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states have been under a state of emergency due to the relentless assaults.The Islamist militant group has bombed churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders.Boko Haram -- whose name means 'Western education is sin' in the local Hausa language -- says it wants to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law.Violence related to the group killed 1,500 in the first three months of this year alone.As the Nigerian military battles the brutal militants, it's breaking the rules as well. Rights group accuse both sides of ruthlessness -- Boko Haram of indiscriminate attacks, and the military of extrajudicial killings.And as the militants step up their attacks, Ayuba is just glad to be alive.'It was God that saved me. He kept me alive on purpose, and I ask God every day to relieve that purpose to me,' he said.He walks away with a limp, his scars a symbol of an insurgency that will not be forgotten.CNN's Vladimir Duthiers reported from Abuja, and CNN's Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.

Don't bet on it (Opinion)", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/10/31/opinion/kew-boko-haram-talks/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Editor's note: Darren Kew is associate professor and chairman of the Department of Conflict Resolution, Human Security, and Global Governance at UMASS Boston, and Executive Director of its Center for Peace, Democracy, and Development. The views expressed are his own.(CNN) -- In the wake of the six-month anniversary of Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls two weeks ago, the Nigerian military released a terse statement that it had negotiated a ceasefire with the cult-like Islamist insurgency, saying it would be finalizing the details for return of most of the girls this week. The announcement came as a surprise, since the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan had refused to negotiate for the girls' release up to that point.What is going on?Boko Haram has yet to comment publicly on any of this, and instead attacked two villages the day after the purported ceasefire. Last week, they reportedly abducted another 30 children. The Nigerian military has, for its part, regularly made false or misleading statements throughout the insurgency, which spread in earnest beginning in 2011, and which has seen Boko Haram expand control of territory in the northeast of the country. Yet despite these developments, the Nigerian government maintains that talks with the insurgents are progressing in neighboring Chad.If the government really is in talks, then it represents the best prospect for the return of the girls since they were kidnapped in April. Still, a real resolution of the insurgency -- and an end to Boko Haram's current tactics -- seems remote. After all, kidnapping is one of the most important sources of Boko Haram financing, and the girls' return will certainly come at a heavy price. Moreover, the movement's goal of installing its medieval version of a Taliban-style state in as much of Nigeria as it can capture leaves little room for negotiating some form of a permanent settlement.But that is all looking ahead. In the meantime, there is the complicated issue of determining the Nigerian government's motivations for agreeing to a ceasefire and negotiations.Up to this point, the inaction and/or ineptitude of President Goodluck Jonathan's administration in managing both Boko Haram and the liberation of the kidnapped girls has prompted heavy criticism within Nigeria and abroad. The success of the #BringBackOurGirls movement, which has kept a daily demonstration alive in Abuja since April, and enjoys the support of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and a chorus of celebrities, underscores public frustration with the Nigerian government's poor management of Boko Haram.Why the government, which earns roughly $100 billion annually from oil revenues alone, cannot finish the job is the source of intense debate across Nigeria. Massive sums of public funds are being released for the counterinsurgency effort, but troops in the theater of operations have mutinied several times over lack of equipment and allegations that officers are stealing their pay.Just as shocking as the corruption is the apparent indifference of the government to the emergency. The very day that Boko Haram kidnapped the schoolgirls in April, just a day after it set off a bomb at a bus stop killing over 70 innocent victims, President Jonathan reportedly danced and sang at a political rally for himself and his ruling party as general elections approach in February 2015. Not only did the military have a four-hour warning that the attack on the girls' village was imminent, according to Amnesty International, but it took them two weeks to respond.To his credit, President Jonathan met with his security chiefs about the kidnappings the day after the political rally, and also visited the bus stop shortly after the bombings took place. But his political priorities appear clear -- spending the majority of his energies seeking to stave off the growing political opposition to his re-election plans. Despite a major insurgency that is threatening a third of the nation and displacing over 250,000 people, by some estimates, the business of politics, it seems, comes first.And what a business it is. Earlier this year, the internationally respected governor of the central bank announced that $20 billion of Nigeria's oil earnings were unaccounted for by the state-owned oil company, and that he planned to investigate. Rather than applauding these anti-corruption efforts, the President sacked the governor. In a surreal public debate, the finance minister counter-argued that 'only' $10.8 billion was missing.While 85% of Nigerians live on less than $2 per day, the Nigerian media report almost daily accusations of audacious spending and corruption across government at all levels, from gold-plated iPhones allegedly distributed to guests at the President's daughter's wedding, to the minister of petroleum reportedly spending millions in public funds on chartered aircraft for private trips.As a result of all this, fears are growing that government claims of the girls' imminent release is a public relations stunt designed for election year consumption and to divert attention from the Jonathan administration's problems. Not only has Boko Haram embarked upon new attacks and kidnappings in recent days, but Nigerian journalists are also reporting that the man the government says is representing Boko Haram at the talks in Chad is a fraud. The media-savvy head of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, has yet to comment, but the government has wrongly claimed to kill him twice already, only to have him appear in another online video.Of course, if the negotiations prove to be real and succeed in reuniting the girls with their families, the Jonathan administration has a brief opportunity to initiate a process that could end the insurgency. Boko Haram is a movement of many parts, the most extreme controlled by the Shekau network. But other factions are interested in a negotiated settlement and have requested mediators on several occasions. If the Nigerian government can engage these fence-sitters in the movement in a peace process that offers some measure of amnesty, it may be able to isolate Shekau and the hardliners sufficiently to bring them to justice and end the war.Unfortunately, with so much at stake in the coming elections, there seems a very real chance that the Jonathan administration will return its attention to the business of politics, and lose this opportunity to change course. If so, it will face not only the weary Nigerian electorate at the ballot box in the coming months, but also a growing insurgency that may see less and less reason to negotiate.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:23:01Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028085819-newday-vo-sesay-boko-haram-00004013-story-top.jpg", "id": 5645}, {"title": "Burkina Faso President resigns; military in charge", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/burkina-faso-unrest/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Burkina Faso's military chief is now the head of state of the West African nation, after unrest that led to the resignation of President Blaise Compaore.Gen.

Later that night, a few miles down the road, Lebanese soldiers and Hezbollah fighters would rush to thwart insurgents trying to descend the mountains from the Syrian border, but on Mr. Fayyads patrol through this remote Christian village, nothing moved.Mr. Fayyad, a municipal employee, is among many local men joining new security patrols to protect the village amid growing tensions along the border. Ras Baalbek is determined to stay out of the Syrian conflict, even as it is pushed toward deeper reliance on one of the combatants, Hezbollah, which is battling insurgents in Syria.Like Christians across Lebanon, the volunteers in Ras Baalbek are divided on Hezbollah, the powerful Shiite Muslim militia, which grew from its roots here in the Bekaa Valley into the countrys strongest political and military force. Some belong to pro-Hezbollah political factions and, residents say, have quietly accepted guns from the group to defend Ras Baalbek. Others are suspicious of Hezbollahs Islamist ideology and its alliance with the Syrian government that long occupied Lebanon.The split here reflects a larger one across Lebanon about the role and standing of Hezbollah a year and a half after it sent fighters into Syria in a decisive intervention against insurgents in Qusayr, just across the border from here. It has since waged an expeditionary war that has both strained and galvanized its Shiite base, and renewed debate in Lebanon on the ability of one political party, however influential, to commit the country to war.But here in Ras Baalbek, at least, the encroaching conflict has forged a new, provisional unity. Even longtime critics of Hezbollah grudgingly welcome its presence as a bulwark between them and the Syrian and foreign Sunni militants in the highlands, although some blame Hezbollah for inflaming the threat. The critics contend that Hezbollahs military intervention in Syria has dragged Lebanon closer to war, while supporters say that without it, extremists crossing from Syria might have already driven Christians from the northern Bekaa Valley, along with the Shiites who are a majority here.Maybe if they hadnt gone to Syria, we wouldnt have these problems, the village mayor, Hisham al-Arja, said on a recent night in his hunting shop, where business is down because of Lebanese vacationers new fears of the area. And maybe if they hadnt gone, the extremists would have come to us sooner. Its a very hard question. Everyone tells the story his own way.For now, of course, we all want to be on the same side, he said.In recent statements, Hezbollahs leaders have credited their fighters with defending Lebanon against a wave of extremist Sunni militancy that could threaten the country, the most religiously diverse in the region. Al Akhbar, a left-leaning Lebanese daily, recently published a telephone poll conducted last month by the Beirut Center for Research and Information that found that two-thirds of Christians said Hezbollah was protecting Lebanon.In Ras Baalbek, that sentiment is strong, but it comes with some ambivalence. The Rev. Ibrahim Nehmo, the priest at St. Elian Greek Catholic Church, put it this way: We feel positive about Hezbollah today, but not as positive as their communities do.We are not asking them to come here, he said. But I profit from Hezbollah. I am not fully with Hezbollah, but if Hezbollah is powerful, I am not sad.At the church, deserted on a recent weekday, red and blue stained glass filtered light into a quiet sanctuary. A sign on the door displayed the insecurities of Christians, who are more powerful in Lebanon than in any other Arab country but see themselves as increasingly beleaguered in the region.This land belongs to our people, it read. Some of us have died, some of us are still alive, but some of us havent been born yet. This land is not for sale.The priest said Ras Baalbek had been wary of demographic change since refugees, mostly Sunni, began flooding into Lebanon three years ago.The makeshift tents that have sprung up throughout the valley are forbidden here, and only Syrians whose relatives have previously worked as laborers in Ras Baalbek are welcome. A curfew on Syrians runs from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. That has given the village an air of being untouched by the conflict, unlike the nearby Christian town of Qaa, which is thronged with refugees.But fears in Ras Baalbek deepened, Father Nehmo said, after militants from the Islamic State, the extremist group that seeks to establish a caliphate throughout the Middle East, swept into the Iraqi city of Mosul in June, displacing one of the regions oldest Christian communities.Daesh created a phobia, he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. He said he now joked with a friend, a Sunni doctor, that she might be Daesh.As a Christian, he said, he was also wary of all Islamist movements, including Hezbollah. He compared its public overtures to Christian leaders to his childhood feints, when he would pat his sister gently in front of their father and then, in private, pinch her.He said that militias wielded power at the expense of the army and government, and that he would prefer the Lebanese Army handle the security threat.But the danger is coming, knocking on the door, he said. What can I do?Some of the local Christians on patrol here are with a group called the Resistance Brigades, which supports and receives assistance from Hezbollah, the priest said. Others are from the Lebanese Forces, a Christian party vehemently opposed to Hezbollah.They dont want to say that Hezbollah was right about Syria, Father Nehmo said, so Hezbollah avoids publicizing the role of Christian militias. They dont want to put the Christians in a corner.He and others took pains to push back against news reports that painted the new local forces guarding Christian towns as a throwback to factional militias from Lebanons long civil war a generation ago, likening them instead to a neighborhood watch that includes all factions.That night, Mr. Fayyad, on his patrol, stopped by a small house decorated with stone sculptures of a guitar and an oud, a pear-shaped string instrument. Inside, Georges Bitar, who owns an oud workshop in Beirut, played a song about the apricots of Baalbek by the Lebanese diva Fayrouz. Then, as his wife served cake, he showed off his flak vest and rifle.He said he had moved back to his hometown from Beirut several months earlier to help defend it. If Daesh comes, he said, I will fight them.But the mayor, Mr. Arja, said Hezbollah would never let things get to that point. If they come here, for Hezbollah it is as if they entered one of their areas, he said.Christians are not part of this war, he added: Though it may not have begun as one, its a Shiite-Sunni war.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-11-04T00:11:35Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/02/world/02baalbek-1/02baalbek-1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 4561}, {"title": "Airstrike on ISIS stronghold kills 15", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/08/world/meast/iraq-violence/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- At least 15 people were killed and 31 were wounded in an airstrike in the strategic Iraqi town of Al-Qaim, in Anbar province, on the border with Syria, a witness said Saturday.The strike hit a market near an ISIS checkpoint in the town, according to the resident who cannot be named for safety reasons.

There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders, Hogan-Howe said.Speaking at a national security conference in London, he said militants activities were not just the horrors of distant lands and warned of the terrorist threat posed in the UK by returning fighters.Mamunur Roshid, 24, was known to be one of six men from Portsmouth who travelled to Syria in 2013 and reports by religious leaders in the city that he had died follow the deaths of Ifthekar Jaman, 23, last December and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, in July.Experts in tracking the movements of foreign fighters in wartorn Syria said Roshid may have been killed in the continuing battle for Kobani, where Isis is fighting Kurds and the US air force for control of the town, which borders Turkey.Hogan-Howe said: The advance of IS across Iraq and Syria, which happened incredibly quickly, indeed now towards Turkey, are not just the horrors of distant lands.We know that over 500 British nationals travelled to join the conflict. Many have returned and many will wish to do so in the coming months and perhaps in future years.The Met say they have made 218 arrests for terrorist-related activity this year, an increase of about 70% in three years.A large part of this increased arrest rate is due to terrorist activities, plots and planning linked to Syria. The trend is, I think, set to continue, Hogan-Howe said.He added that the return of potentially militarised individuals to the streets of the UK is a risk to our communities.The chair of Portsmouths Jami mosque, Abdul Jalil, said the local community were shocked to hear of another young mans death and there were reports that a fourth man from the city was in hospital in Syria.It is very sad. The family got the news on Sunday evening that he died on Friday  [and] that it was in Syria.We are very worried about this. The imam will speak about this at the mosque on Friday, telling people not to go to Syria, he added.We are doing everything we can, we are speaking with the council, the crime prevention team. We are handing out leaflets about what is happening there.Roshid was part of a group of five Bengali men who travelled from the port city in October to join Jaman, also from Portsmouth.Details of their journey via a flight from Gatwick to Antalya, Turkey, emerged in May when one of the five, Mashudur Choudhury, 31, became the first Briton to be convicted of terrorism offences related to the Syrian conflict.Choudhury said he got to know Roshid a few months before he left for Syria last October and had him in his phone as Mamun Sleepyhead.The guy loves his food, hes always eating, thats why I described him as a sleepy person, [although] we were not good friends.Earlier this month, two houses in Portsmouth, including Jamans family home, were among properties raided by counter-terrorism police.Officers from the south-east counter-terrorism unit have been granted until 28 October to question some of those involved in arrests following the raids which included Jamans brothers, Tuhim, 26, and Mustakim, 23 and his brother.Shiraz Maher, a senior researcher at Kings College Londons international centre for the study of radicalism, said: It is probable that Roshid died in the battle for Kobani as another of his Portsmouth counterparts, Muhammad Mehdi Hasan, is known to be fighting there, although we havent been able to independently verify this yet.Maher says the centre has so far confirmed the deaths of more than 20 jihadis who have travelled from Britain to fight in Syria.The Portsmouth cluster of fighters is perhaps one of the best known. In total six men went to join Islamic State last year.

Now that the planning has advanced, more than a dozen Iraqi and American officials provided details about a strategy that is certain to become increasingly visible.The basic strategy calls for attacking fighters from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, with a goal of isolating them in major strongholds like Mosul.That could enable Iraqi troops, Kurdish pesh merga units and fighters that have been recruited from Sunni tribes to take on a weakened foe that has been cut off from its supply lines and reinforcements in Syria, which are subject to American airstrikes.To oversee the American military effort, a new task force is being established under Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, who oversees Army forces in the Middle East and who will operate from a base in Kuwait. Maj. Gen. Paul E. Funk II will run a subordinate headquarters in Baghdad that will supervise the hundreds of American advisers and trainers working with Iraqi forces.As the push to train Iraqs military gathers momentum, the American footprint is likely to expand from Baghdad and Erbil to additional outposts, including Al Asad Air Base in Iraqs embattled Anbar Province in the west, and possibly Taji, 20 miles north of Baghdad.The effort to rebuild Iraqs fighting capability faces hurdles, including the risk that the Islamic State will use the intervening months to entrench in western and northern Iraq and carry out more killings.The United States currently does not plan to advise Iraqi forces below the level of a brigade, which in the Iraqi Army usually has some 2,000 troops. Nor is it clear under what circumstances the White House might allow American advisers to accompany Iraqi units on the battlefield or to call in airstrikes, as Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has indicated might be necessary.Iraqs recent history suggests that such a battlefield advisory role is likely to be needed. Iraqi forces faltered during their 2008 offensive against Shiite militias in Basra until American commanders sent their troops to advise Iraqi forces below the brigade level and facilitate airstrikes.As the plan stands now, no American agency has been assigned to train Iraqs police, although they will be responsible for protecting areas that have been cleared by the army.Iraqs Shiite militias, some of which have been supported by Iran, pose another obstacle. Antony J. Blinken, President Obamas deputy national security adviser, said last week that it was important that the Shiite militias be withdrawn, disband or have their members integrated into Iraqs security forces.But Fuad Masum, the Iraqi president, has suggested that the militias could be needed until the Islamic State was thoroughly defeated.A major challenge will be synchronizing the Iraqi campaign with the American effort to train the beleaguered moderate Syrian opposition. The Pentagons program to train 5,000 Syrian rebel fighters a year in Saudi Arabia and Turkey has yet to get underway, which raises the possibility that Islamic State fighters could be pushed back into Syria well before there is a trained and equipped Syrian rebel force to oppose them.Another constraint is self-imposed. Military officials say the White House has limited the number of United States advisers, analysts and security personnel in Iraq to 1,600. There were 1,414 troops in Iraq as of Friday, about 600 of whom were acting in advisory roles from joint operations centers in Baghdad and Erbil, and at division and higher headquarters.A White House spokesman, Alistair Baskey, said the figure was not a limit, just the number of troops required for the current missions. One senior United States official, who asked not be identified because he was discussing internal planning, said it was likely that the number would need to be raised. Army planners have drafted options that could deploy up to an additional brigade of troops, or about 3,500 personnel, to expand the advisory effort and speed the push to rebuild the Iraqi military.The Iraqi military has been active in recent weeks, but these operations have taken a toll on its forces. United States officials say that the initial force they are planning to advise consists of only nine Iraqi brigades and three similar Kurdish pesh merga units  roughly 24,000 troops.The counterattack plan calls for at least doubling that force by adding three divisions, each of which could range from 8,000 to 12,000 troops.The United States is relying on allies to augment American trainers. Australia, Canada and Norway have committed several hundred special forces to one or more of the training or advisory missions, a senior United States military official said.A parallel effort calls for establishing new national guard brigades in each of Iraqs 18 provinces  units that would report to the local governors and have the primary responsibility for securing those areas after the Iraqi Army has mounted its counteroffensive.The national guard initiative has been promoted by American officials as a way for Sunnis in western and northern Iraq to play a major role in defending their territory, which would ease sectarian frictions.But the Iraqi Parliament has yet to enact legislation to establish the brigades, which would still need to be trained and equipped.As a result, a bridge policy would be needed so that the Iraqi government, with American help, could work directly with Sunni tribes in the meantime, Mr. Blinken said at a conference hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace last week.General Dempsey said Friday that ISIS recent gains in Anbar show why we need to expand the train, advise and assist mission into Anbar Province.A senior United States official said that much of this bridging initiative has yet to be defined. But an early test is expected to unfold soon in Anbar, where about 5,000 Sunni tribesmen could join the fight against the Islamic State in a replay of the pivotal American effort in 2007 to enlist Sunni tribal leaders to turn against Al Qaedas affiliate in Iraq, the forerunner of the Islamic State.Overcoming Sunni wariness of the Shiite-led government in Baghdad will be challenging, American officials said.James M. Dubik, a retired three-star Army general who oversaw training of the Iraqi military during the surge in 2007 and 2008, said the most critical part of the campaign would be the effort to win the allegiance of Iraqis after the Islamic State is routed.Behind it has to come some reasonably legitimate, evenhanded and nonsectarian governance over those areas that are taken back from ISIS, he said.Even if the overall Iraqi plan succeeds by the end of 2015, American officials say, pockets of resistance could remain. American commanders acknowledge that the effort to defeat ISIS will be lengthy.This is not going to happen in three weeks, a month, two months, Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff and a former top commander in Iraq, told CNN on Wednesday. Its a three- to four-year effort.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-11-04T00:10:53Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 4527}, {"title": "Tunisia forces storm 'militant hideout' killing six", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29753423", "text": "Tunisian security forces have stormed a house in a Tunis suburb to end a stand-off with armed militants, killing six people, officials said.One gunman and five women were killed in the raid on the house in the Oued Ellil area, officials said.An interior ministry spokesman described all six as 'terrorists'.

Yet there was noise all around him -- and all for him.One day earlier, Vickers -- the sergeant-at-arms of Canada's House of Commons -- was credited with gunning down an armed man who'd stormed in minutes after killing a Canadian soldier standing guard at a nearby veterans memorial.Parliamentarians responded Thursday by saluting Vickers with a spirited standing ovation as he walked, in front of the line, as part of his ceremonial duties to usher the start of a new session. Their fervent applause was interrupted only by occasional cheers and pounding of benches.Yet Vickers, carrying a ceremonial sword and dressed in traditional attire, nodded gently to acknowledge the ovation but didn't address the crowd. The only time he spoke, and the only hint of a smile, came when Prime Minister Stephen Harper walked back to the sergeant-at-arms seat in the back of the hall -- at which point the two shook hands and Vickers whispered a few words in Harper's ear.The sergeant-at-arms did offer remarks -- his first since the shootings -- later in a written statement. He said he was 'very touched' by the attention over his role in ending the attack, while adding that he has 'the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors' to Parliament.'Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team,' he said.Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau traded gunshots with an officer before heading down a hall towards Parliament, where Vickers and others engaged him.'I understood that the suspect and Mr. Vickers were behind pillars and exchanging fire,' Paulson said. 'The suspect repositioned himself to get a better shot at Mr. Vickers ... We heard (a) multitude of shots, and that Mr. Vickers did shoot.'How do you characterize what the 58-year-old Vickers did that day?Members of Parliament, the media and the public resoundingly settled on one word: hero.As parliamentarian Craig Scott tweeted, 'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers.'Vickers isn't a stranger to the spotlight, although he's typically on the edge of it.When world leaders come through Ottawa, he is often right beside them at the House of Commons. Photo after photo from the past few years show him, a handful of Canadian politicians and the international figures -- from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to South Korean President Park Geun-Hye -- on hand.This is all part of the ceremonial duties of sergeant-at-arms, a position that's been occupied by only 10 people since its inception in 1867. Vickers, for instance, is sometimes charged with carrying a special sword in the commission of his duties.Yet, for all the pomp and circumstance, Vickers is above all a man of the law. That speaks to his bigger role at the House of Commons as its top law enforcement officer, charged with overseeing security on the grounds and safeguarding various officials.To put what he did Wednesday in perspective, consider this: He was like a police chief or sheriff who takes out his weapon and ends a violent attack.On the one hand, Vickers isn't new to law enforcement, having spent 28 years with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Yet despite all that time, his brother believes that Wednesday was the first time Vickers ever exchanged gunfire with anyone.'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'Who was the gunman?Reporter who knows Vickers calls him 'an utmost professional'John Vickers describes his brother as 'an exemplary individual who, throughout ... his career, put his country and his community first.'That includes all his years with Canada's national police force, including a high-profile stint in the province of New Brunswick during a tense time there.'He was always cool under pressure; he was always respectful and accommodating,' Andree Lau, a former CBC journalist who is now The Huffington Post's British Columbia news editor, told CNN.Lau remembers Vickers, from the time she met him in the 2000s, as 'a stand-up guy (who is) well-trained.'Asked about his exploits Wednesday, Lau said, 'It's not surprising at all. Because (Vickers) is an utmost professional.'Vickers left the RCMP to become the House of Commons' security director, the CBC reported. He became sergeant-at-arms in 2006, where he has impressed many with his demeanor as much as his professionalism.Tweeted Glenn Thibeault, a parliamentarian from Sudbury: 'Sgt at arms Kevin Vickers-nicest guy you'll ever meet. I am lucky to call him a friend.'Today he is also our hero and we are 4evr grateful.'", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:13:55Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141023101700-bts-kevin-vickers-leads-procession-ottawa-00013204-story-top.jpg", "id": 3423}, {"title": "Coalition hits ISIS in Syria; group makes gains in Iraq", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/10/14/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- ISIS appears to have gained more ground in Iraq.Islamic State fighters surrounded one of Iraq's largest air bases Tuesday, a police captain in Anbar province and other security sources told CNN. The militants are preparing to launch an attack on Ein Al-Assad military airbase, which is halfway between Hit and Haditha, said Anbar police Capt. Omar Mohamad Hanin.Anbar has been largely overrun by ISIS, which has been waging war for months in order to establish a caliphate -- or a society run by strict Sharia law. It has also taken over large swaths of Syria, near the border with Turkey.Coalition forces have been trying to battle back, but ISIS is getting into position in Iraq with rocket launchers and tanks in villages to the south and east of Ein Al-Assad, Hanin said.President Barack Obama said he is focused on the fighting taking place in Anbar and vowed airstrikes will continue there and elsewhere.'This is going to be a long-term campaign, there are no quick fixes involved,' he said Tuesday at Joint Base Andrews, during a meeting of military leaders from 22 countries who are part of the coalition fighting ISIS.'We're still in the early stages,' the President said. 'As with any military efforts there will be days of progress and there will be periods of setback, but our coalition is united behind this long-term effort.'Nearly 60 countries are now part of the effort to stop ISIS.Two deadly car bombs exploded in Baghdad on Monday and one on Tuesday. The militants claimed they were behind the blasts. One targeted the police checkpoint in the Shiite neighborhood of Khadimiya.Four people were killed and 12 others were injured when a car bomb being driven by a someone on a suicide mission exploded in an area called al-Utayfia. The target was a security checkpoint at one of the entrances to the predominately Shiite neighborhood, police officials told CNN.ISIS released a statement on its media site claiming that the al-Khadimiya attack killed a member of the Iraqi Parliament, Ahmad al-Khafaji, who was a member of the Badr Organization, a main Shiite bloc in the government.On the surface, Badgad remained calm Tuesday, despite ISIS advances from the west. Ali, who sells fish at a market, noted that ISIS has taken control of even more territory since the coalition airstrikes began.Nearby, Walid, who sells fruit and has two sons in the Iraqi army, said the airstrikes are 'like theater.'The Iraqi army's track record in fighting ISIS is not good. It has lost control of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and is now struggling to keep control over Anbar.In Syria, ISIS fighters bombed and blasted their way through the strategic city of Kobani. Columns of smoke rose as the sound of gunfire erupted.Coalition airpower -- aided by Saudi Arabia -- has been focused intensely on Syria. U.S. Central Command said Tuesday that it had bombarded ISIS near Kobani, using bomber and fighter aircraft to fire 21 airstrikes that destroyed two ISIS staging locations, a building, a truck and two vehicles and damaged other ISIS property.Another U.S. strike near the Syrian city of Dayr az Zawr struck a modular oil refinery and initial indications are that this strike was successful.The strikes are meant to prevent the extremist Muslim group from resupplying and massing combat power on the Kurdish-held portions of Kobani, Central Command said in a release.All coalition aircraft used in missions against ISIS departed the space safely, the military said, and analysis of the strikes suggests that they slowed ISIS' advance.But Central Command warned that 'the security situation on the ground there remains fluid' with ISIS attempting to gain territory and beat back the Kurdish military, which is putting up a fierce fight.Turkey In or Out?The fight for Kobani brings ISIS right to the border with Turkey, but Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS remain unclear.After U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that Turkey had agreed to allow the United States and its partners to use an air base and territory for training, Turkish officials said Monday that they had not decided whether to allow use of the Incirlik airbase.On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that Turkey is still committed.'I mean, Turkey has agreed to host and train and equip people. It certainly has allowed the use of certain facilities, and we don't need to get into the specifics except to say that I don't believe there is any discrepancy with respect to what they will or won't do.''Kobani is caught in between the United States and Turkey. It's a pawn right now,' retired Col. Derek Harvey, the former special adviser to Army Gen. David Petraeus, told CNN's Hala Gorani.Turkey is still focused on removing Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has been fighting it's own battle with Kurdish separatists inside Turkey, Harvey said. Turkey even launched strikes against Kurdish positions within Turkey in recent days, according to its military.Kobani is an example of the fissures that exist within the coalition about the overall strategic goal, Harvey said.CNN's Ben Wedeman, Hamdi Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-10-15T05:00:10Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141014150942-syria-isis-kobani-smoke-story-top.jpg", "id": 781}, {"title": "Iraqi Peshmerga to enter Kobani to fight ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/28/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) -- Kurdish fighters from Iraq will enter the besieged Syrian border city of Kobani this week to reinforce fellow Kurds who are defending against ISIS, a Peshmerga general told CNN on Tuesday.'The Peshmerga have been ready for a few days, then had logistical problems, but they no longer do,' Brig. Gen. Halgurd Hikmat said of the Iraqi Kurdish forces. 'They will possibly be leaving today or tomorrow.'He added that 'we now have an agreement with Turkey on this.'Another source -- an official with the Ministry of Peshmerga, effectively the defense ministry for the semiautonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq -- said 161 Peshmerga fighters were making the trip.The troops have weapons 'that will be of good help to our brothers in Kobani,' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The Peshmerga militia generally defends the Kurdish region in northern Iraq and has battled ISIS in that nation.Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment. But Turkey has previously said it will allow the Peshmerga to pass through its territory into Syria to join the fight for Kobani, which lies on the Syrian-Turkish border.Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayan al-Arab, is a largely Kurdish town defended by a Kurdish-Syrian militia.With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into Kobani is through Turkey.Hikmat would not confirm how the Kurdish fighters from Iraq would join the Kurdish defenders in Kobani but said they would bring weapons and would participate in the fighting.The weapons would be Saddam Hussein-era gear collected in Iraq, not new coalition armaments, Hikmat added.ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, captured portions of Syria and Iraq this year in its bid to establish what it says is an independent Islamic nation. ISIS began attacking Kobani in September.The Ministry of Peshmerga official also said Tuesday that the Peshmerga would be in Kobani on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.Turkey's decision to let the Peshmerga traverse Turkish territory to reinforce the Kurdish fighters in Kobani represented a major policy shift.The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population are Kurds.Turkey, the European Union and United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization.Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said both the Syrian Kurdish and ISIS militants were 'terrorists.' The Turkish government also has bristled at the United States' efforts to parachute weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters.But while Turkey did nothing to intervene in Kobani, Kurds protested in Turkish streets. More than 30 people were killed in cities around Turkey this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups as well as Turkish police.Turkey announced October 20 that it would allow Iraqi Peshmerga to travel into Kobani through Turkey.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Gaziantep, Turkey.

You look at refugees like this and you think: everything.Any second now, it seems as if Syrias Kurdish border city of Kobani will fall. Amazingly, Kurds have been holding their ground, and western air strikes have yielded positive results, according to the regions top leader, who says that with the help of US and coalitions jets, we can expel Isis from Kobani and save the lives of these civilians.But such is the danger of positive thinking: unless something happens to drastically shift the balance of power on the ground, the Islamic State (Isis) may eventually overtake the city, forcing many times more than the 200,000 Kobanis already in exodus into an unknown future, upheaving the relative peace of Kurdish-controlled Syria and possibly ending to one of the most unheralded ongoing peace discussions in the world.That something is Turkey, which could and should save Kobani  but which has been passively monitoring the death-soaked danger unfolding on its border. The United Nations has warned of genocide on the scale of Srebenica, asking only for volunteers and their equipment to enter the city, but Turkey has refused. Kurdish leaders have called for a corridor to allow weapons and aid transport, but Turkey keeps saying no. Indeed, the only access Kobani has to the outside world is Turkey, with Natos second largest army and its tanks on the border, but Turkish leaders in Ankara simply look on.Why? Such is the danger in stubborn politicking: Ankara does not want Kurdish autonomy, and it is still worried about Bashar al-Assad more than Isis. We are worried about the wrong atrocities, goes this line of thinking, just because Isis is scary. But Turkey has ulterior motives  and they have led not just to a willful ignorance of massacre, but to a willing breakdown in the political peace process.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was supposed to be the architect of that process, which promised a solution to a decades-old standoff on Kurdish rights with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). But just a few days ago, Erdogan said the PKK and Isis were the same, and the PKK responded with harsh statements of its own, going so far as to threaten to mobilize the guerrillas. This isnt helpful, obviously, but is that Turkeys true intention with the Kurds? To prevent Kurdish independence at all costs, just because it is led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is so closely aligned with the PKK and has had so much success actually governing across the border in Syria?Ankara has asked for the creation of a Turkish controlled buffer zone, which would include Kobani and essentially end the autonomous canton system that the Kurds have been governing themselves. The international community is not interested.Ankara has also suggested creating a no-fly zone to weaken Assad, even though  by forcing the PYD and the Kurdish Peoples Protection Unit (YPG) to join the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA), two groups with very little power left on the ground that have never accepted the Kurds as an equal partner  it would essentially weaken the Kurds in Syria, making them depend on Turkeys way of war. The coalition fighting Isis does not seem too interested in that either.When I talk to Syrian Kurds, they seem to believe that Turkey considers their desperate situation merely an opportunity to impose conditions upon them that are virtually impossible to accept: that they give up the Kurdish self-government that has emerged across Syria over the last two years, thus weakening Kurdish aspirations for more autonomy in Turkey.Kurds in Turkey have taken to the streets in mass protest, condemning Erdogans gross passivity but acting with increasing caution, as the jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan says its time for talks. Among the Kurds in both Syria and Turkey, there is a serious concern that the peace process would collapse if Kobani falls, and that Turkish-Kurdish relations will be irreparably damaged.But even if Turkey doesnt care about the Kurds, Turkey should be concerned for itself. If Isis seizes Kobani and the border gate, there is no guarantee that the group will not launch attacks against Turkey in future. At the very least, Isis will gain access to more economic and political resources and be able to recruit new fighters easily. Ankara must accept that the fight for Kobani is not only for the Kurds; it is a fight for Turkey, for the entire region.What does Kobani have to do with Turkey? Erdogan asked over the weekend, rhetorically but to the intense sorrow of Kurds worldwide. The answer, simply, is everything. The Kurds in Turkey and Syria are intertwined, whether Ankara likes it or not. This goes beyond compassion, beyond Erdogans tears for the killing of a the daughter of Muslim Brotherhood leader.By remaining idle, Turkey will always be remembered for its inaction in the face of a rapidly approaching massacre. But Kobani offers an historic opportunity for Turkey to show it is on the right side of history; all it needs to do now is open that safe corridor, and a golden opportunity for reconciliation awaits. All Ankara needs to do now is help those in need, in the face of barbarous terrorism.We are still waiting. Any second now, Mr Erdogan. Any second now.", "source": "http://www.theguardian.com/us", "date": "2014-10-15T02:25:17Z", "top_image": "http://static-secure.guim.co.uk/icons/social/og/gu-logo-fallback.png", "id": 473}, {"title": "Poaching a surprising source of terror funds (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/opinion/poe-poaching-terrorism-funding/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Congressman Ted Poe, R-Texas, is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade, and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The views expressed are his own(CNN) -- Half a million dollars. That's how much it cost Osama bin Laden and his band of extremists to carry out the most deadly attack on U.S. soil since Pearl Harbor.Fast forward 13 years, and bin Laden may be dead, but the threat from Islamic extremists has never been greater. But weapons, surveillance equipment, training, food, lodging and travel all cost money. That suggests that if we want to fight terrorism, then there's one important thing we need to do: Follow the money trail.There are pockets of terrorist organizations all around the world, and global terrorism has become a sophisticated and organized criminal enterprise run by radical operatives. We have seen this most recently with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a terrorist army that has raised billions through extortion, drugs, bank robbery, kidnapping, and oil smuggling. We also saw this with Boko Haram, which kidnapped hundreds of young girls in Nigeria and then reportedly sold some of them for $12 apiece. Money is power and that is no different in the business of terrorism.But while the focus on groups like ISIS has generally been, for example, on their ability to convert the oil fields under their control into cash, there's one source of funding for terrorism that is often overlooked: poaching.The illegal wildlife trade is a $7 billion to $10 billion per year business, with the main consumers of this illicit yet lucrative slaughter business being located in Asia.Why? In China, for example, some believe that ivory and rhino horns have special healing powers. In Vietnam, a rhino horn is a status symbol, one that they also think can cure a hangover. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a rhino horn sells for $65,000 a kilogram in Asia. That's more expensive than silver, gold and diamonds. That's more expensive than cocaine.With that kind of profit available, coupled with the high demand, we have seen poaching rise to astronomical levels. In South Africa, home to 80% of the world's rhino population, the number of rhinos poached rose from 13 in 2007 to 746 in 2013, according to the African Wildlife Foundation. In Central Africa, two-thirds of its forest elephants have been wiped out in the last 10 years.It's no wonder that terrorists have identified this lucrative 'industry' of systematic killing of African animals as another source of cash to fund their murderous enterprise.According to an 18-month investigation commissioned by the Elephant Action League in 2011, the al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab generated between $200,000 and $600,000 a month from tusks. This vast sum of blood money accounted for about 40% of Al-Shabaab's total operating budget. These terrorist poachers not only kill African Animals, but are accused of murdering 60 Wildlife wardens in 2012 as well.Other terrorist organizations implicated in the illegal poaching trade include Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army in Central Africa and Boko Haram in Nigeria. All of this has been done to obtain money for more criminal activity. After all, not only is the money good in poaching, but the risk of apprehension and the consequences are low.Unsurprisingly, terrorists have also taken advantage of the instability and corruption in Africa. They can't operate openly in the world economy because if they do, they are more likely to get caught. So they work under the radar in the black market. That's why we've seen terrorist groups like Hezbollah work with narco-traffickers in Venezuela.According to the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, 'toothless laws, corruption, weak judicial systems, and light punishments allow criminal networks to thrive on wildlife trade with little regard to risk or consequence.' The penalties for those caught poaching are minimal. So for terrorists who are looking to avoid detection, make a lot of money, and not face a lot of consequences if they are caught, poaching is a great fit.The nexus between terrorism and poaching, long overlooked, is getting more attention, but not enough is being done. For starters, there needs to be more intelligence gathering to get a deeper understanding of the issue. Our intelligence community has yet to establish a clear understanding of which terrorist groups are the most involved in poaching, how the money flows, and who facilitates the transactions. We cannot effectively counter a problem we do not sufficiently understand.Second, the Obama administration needs to clearly define who is in charge and what role the different agencies and bureaus within those agencies will play. Multiple agencies -- from the State Department to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- are involved in anti-poaching efforts.Similarly, we don't have an accurate picture of the money we are already spending on anti-poaching efforts because the money gets bundled into broader categories, such as law enforcement support, military training, environmental conservation, etc. We need a cross-cutting budget that outlines exactly how much money we are spending so that we can evaluate whether existing resources are appropriate and sufficient.Finally, we need to turn talk into action. Last February, the Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking issued a National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, but without any sort of implementation plan. Nine months later, we are still waiting. Meanwhile, endangered species are being slaughtered and terrorists are being paid from the sales of endangered species' tusks and horns.Preserving endangered species is a noble goal. And, the fact that killers worldwide are using this money to fund terrorism makes it even more urgent that we stop this ruthless criminal enterprise. The collusion of these two evils -- the killing of endangered species and innocent civilians to further terrorism -- is an international issue. The world cannot allow radical Islamists to continue the wholesale slaughter of rhinos and elephants to fund a reign of terror.And that's just the way it is.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-22T20:13:36Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131114200638-erin-dnt-cabrera-elephant-ivory-destroyed-in-u-s-as-symbolic-act-00003723-story-top.jpg", "id": 2658}, {"title": "ISIS pushed back with help of U.S. airstrikes in Kobani", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Kurdish fighters in the Syrian town of Kobani have pushed back ISIS militants in a number of locations as U.S. airstrikes on ISIS positions continue in and around the city, according to sources there.The battle for Kobani, which is not far from the Turkish border, has become a street fight over control of hills and neighborhoods.One Kurdish fighter told CNN Thursday that ISIS has been forced from many parts of the city, but still controls some key buildings including the hospital and the important Asayish building in the middle of Kobani, which served as headquarters for the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG.The YPG does have control of the southwest entrance of the city and has taken some buildings back from ISIS fighters in one neighborhood, next to the heavily contested eastern industrial area of the city.Activists say Kurdish fighters were able to make significant advances on all fronts around Kobani with the help of coalition airstrikes.U.S. fighter jets conducted 14 strikes near Kobani Wednesday and Thursday, according to U.S. Central Command.Initial reports show the strikes his 19 ISIS buildings and 10 other ISIS targets, including command posts, sniper positions and a staging location, the U.S. military said.The airstrikes over the past few days have helped Kurdish YPG fighters turn into an offensive rather than a defensive force, according to one activist.But, he adds, 'there is still street fighting in the east and in the south' of Kobani.CNN's Ingrid Formanek and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this story", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-16T17:04:31Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141014180433-tsr-dnt-starr-is-us-isis-strategy-working-00014710-story-top.jpg", "id": 1549}, {"title": "Washington monitoring Canada shootings", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/politics/washington-security/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Washington -- one of the world's most secure cities -- is reacting cautiously following the attacks at Canada's Parliament Hill.One soldier who was shot at Canada's National War memorial, located across from the Parliament building, has died.

A spokesman at the Canadian embassy in Washington told CNN that they have locked the front door to non-embassy staff as a 'precautionary measure.'In New York City, the NYPD added extra security to the Canadian consulate as a precaution.The FBI is asking all field offices to raise their alert posture and reminding them of a recent bulletin urging vigilance in the wake of ISIS chatter calling for attacks on military and law enforcement in the US.'Although there is no specific reporting indicating a threat to the United States ...

Edward Thomas, spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN.U.S. advisers currently operate in areas around Baghdad and Irbil in the north of the country. The new proposal would put U.S. troops in the middle of some of the most violent situations in Iraq.Thomas said the plan is still 'under development.''From the beginning of the campaign, we have said that we would expand this type of support to the Iraqi government should they act in a manner that was representative of the security interests of all Iraqis,' Thomas said.U.S. officials maintain that Iraqi support for Sunni tribes going on the offensive against ISIS will be a necessary part in the effort to defeat the militants, who are also called ISIL and refer to themselves as the Islamic State.In a news conference with reporters Thursday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Joint Chiefs chairman, signaled the possibility of the new role when he said the Iraqi government had not yet requested U.S. military support in efforts to defend a Sunni tribe that has suffered mass executions at the hands of ISIS militants.'That's why we need to expand the train-advise-and-assist mission into the Al- Anbar Province,' Dempsey said.

'Witnessed: The Iran Hostage Crisis,' a CNN Special Report, airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET.(CNN) -- It has been 35 years since a group of Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took a group of Americans hostage. You have seen this story play out in movies like 'Argo' and shows like 'Homeland,' but here are six things about the Iran hostage crisis that you may not have known.1) This conflict is often described as the United States' first brush with political Islam.In 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini installed an anti-Western Islamic theocracy, which replaced the pro-Western monarchy of the Shah of Iran. The U.S. was referred to as 'the Great Satan' by the new Iranian government, and Iranians looked at the United States with suspicion because of its role in keeping the Shah in power. Iranians felt the United States meddled too much in Iran's internal affairs, and were afraid the CIA was plotting to return the Shah to power. The Ayatollah himself blessed the hostage-taking at the embassy, further fueling the government's hard line against the United States.2) The U.S. Embassy in Tehran warned Washington the embassy would be attacked.By October 1979, the Shah had fled Iran and was staying in Mexico. There, doctors discovered the Shah was suffering from an aggressive cancer and recommended he be admitted to a hospital in the United States. The situation in Tehran was already tense, and the head of the diplomatic mission at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran sent several cables to Washington, saying that if the Shah was allowed to come to the United States for treatment, the embassy would be taken. President Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah into the United States, with much hesitation, and the Iranians were outraged. They saw this as an excuse to bring the Shah to the United States to plot his return to power. This was just weeks before the embassy was attacked.3) Some of the hostages were beaten and tortured, and even underwent a mock execution.Iran has maintained a narrative that the hostages were treated well, but that is not true. Not all the hostages were treated the same. The two women, Ann Swift and Kathryn Koob, said they were treated 'correctly' by their captors, but others, including Al Golacinski, John Limbert and Rick Kupke, were subject to a mock execution, where they were awakened in the middle of the night, forced to strip to their underwear and marched to a room in the basement where their guards made it seem they were about to be executed by firing squad. The guards fired their weapons, but they were not loaded. Then the guards laughed. Why did they do it? Limbert said it was because 'they thought it would be fun.'4) The hostages were released only after President Reagan was sworn in.Ted Koppel described this as the Iranians' last act of cruelty toward President Carter. Even though the United States and Iran had come to an agreement to free the hostages in December, the Iranians waited literally until the hour President Reagan was sworn in before allowing the plane with the hostages to take off. The Iranians had a deep hatred of Carter and wanted to deny him this last moment of victory as President.5) After the hostages were released, they met with President Jimmy Carter.William Daugherty, who was held in solitary confinement for almost the entire time he was a hostage, said, 'It was not a warm welcome' when Jimmy Carter flew to the U.S. military base in Germany to meet the hostages right after their release. The hostages were split on their thinking. Many felt they were left unprotected in the embassy after Carter made the decision to allow the Shah into the United States. Daugherty said that during the meeting, Carter went around to hug all the hostages, and many remained still with their arms at their sides and did not return his hug.6) The former U.S. Embassy in Tehran has been preserved as a museum.The embassy in Tehran is now an Islamic cultural center and a museum, preserved from the days when it was a prison in 1979. It stands as a symbol of the Iranian revolution, and is known in Iran as the 'den of spies.' Old typewriters, communication equipment, even old visa photos, are on display. Every year on the anniversary of the hostage taking, Iranians hold rallies where 'Death to America' is chanted, just as it was in 1979.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:50:56Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141027153923-01-iran-hostage-crisis-restricted-story-top.jpg", "id": 3972}, {"title": "More Than 600 Reported Chemical Exposure in Iraq, Pentagon Acknowledges", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/world/middleeast/-more-than-600-reported-chemical-weapons-exposure-in-iraq-pentagon-acknowledges.html", "text": "More than 600 American service members since 2003 have reported to military medical staff members that they believe they were exposed to chemical warfare agents in Iraq, but the Pentagon failed to recognize the scope of the reported cases or offer adequate tracking and treatment to those who may have been injured, defense officials say.The Pentagons disclosure abruptly changed the scale and potential costs of the United States encounters with abandoned chemical weapons during the occupation of Iraq, episodes the military had for more than a decade kept from view.This previously untold chapter of the occupation became public after an investigation by The New York Times revealed last month that although troops did not find an active weapons of mass destruction program, they did encounter degraded chemical weapons from the 1980s that had been hidden in caches or used in makeshift bombs.The Times initially disclosed 17 cases of American service members who were injured by sarin or a sulfur mustard agent. And since the report was published last month, more service members have come forward, pushing the number who were exposed to chemical agents to more than 25. But an internal review of Pentagon records ordered by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has now uncovered that hundreds of troops told the military they believe they were exposed, officials said.The new and larger tally of potential cases suggests that there were more encounters with chemical weapons than the United States had acknowledged and that other people  including foreign soldiers, private contractors and Iraqi troops and civilians  may also have been at risk.Having not acted for years on that data, the Pentagon says it will now expand outreach to veterans. One first step, officials said, includes a toll-free national telephone hotline for service members and veterans to report potential exposures and seek medical evaluation or care.Phillip Carter, who leads veterans programs at the Center for a New American Security, called the Pentagons failure to organize and follow up on the information a stunning oversight. Paul Rieckhoff, founder and executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said the military must restore trust by sharing information.We need total transparency and absolute candor, Mr. Rieckhoff said, and noted the militarys poor record in releasing information about its use in Vietnam of Agent Orange, a chemical defoliant linked to an array of health problems, and in sharing data about troops presumed chemical exposures and other medical and environmental risks during and soon after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.Military officers said the previously unacknowledged data was discovered when, at Mr. Hagels prodding, the Armys Public Health Command examined its collection of standardized medical-history surveys, known as post-deployment health assessments, which troops filled out as they completed combat tours.The assessments included the following question: Do you think you were exposed to any chemical, biological and radiological warfare agents during this deployment? For those who answered yes, the forms provided a block for a brief narrative explanation.Col. Jerome Buller, a spokesman for the Army surgeon general, said Thursday that the review showed that 629 people answered yes to that question and also filled in the block with information indicating chemical agent exposure.Those who answered the questionnaire would have received medical consultations at the end of their combat tours, Colonel Buller said.Why the military did not take further steps  including compiling the data as it accumulated over more than a decade, tracking veterans with related medical complaints, or circulating warnings about risks to soldiers and to the Department of Veterans Affairs  remained unclear.Before post-deployment assessments were reviewed, Colonel Buller said, the Public Health Command had already expanded its search for potential victims and intended to examine the medical records of all troops assigned to units that the Army has belatedly acknowledged handled chemical weapons or were attacked with them.These include three Army explosive ordnance disposal companies and B Company, First Battalion, 14th Infantry, he said.Veterans said this unit list was incomplete and would inevitably grow as the military accounted for other high-risk troops, including those on route-clearance duties in areas where chemical roadside bombs were repeatedly found, or chemical warfare troops who served in so-called technical escort units, which were assigned to collect and analyze the old chemical weapons.Nonetheless, the new data has prompted the Public Health Command to take further steps, Colonel Buller said.These will include identifying all veterans who reported a possible chemical exposure, gathering their medical records, contacting them for a structured interview and perhaps inviting them for a medical exam.He said the Department of Defense had also revived a telephone line, 1-800-497-6261, for veterans to notify the Pentagon that they may have been exposed. The phone line, he said, had previously been used for veterans reporting Gulf War-related illnesses.Immediate reactions among exposed service members and veterans advocates mixed cautious appreciation with skepticism.Its too little, too late, said Jordan Zoeller, a former Army sergeant who served in a platoon that was exposed to a sulfur mustard agent as soldiers destroyed buried chemical artillery shells near Taji in 2008.Mr. Zoeller was medically retired after developing a series of health problems, including asthma and psoriasis. He said his breathing trouble began within weeks of the chemical episode, though he is not sure its onset was related to a mustard agent because the Army denied that he had been exposed and did not examine his claims.No one ever believed me, he said. They were like, Oh, that never happened.He said at one point after he returned to the States and coughed up blood and lost consciousness, a regimental surgeon agreed to look into the episode. Nothing came of it, he said.Another veteran, a Navy explosive-ordnance disposal technician who remains on active duty, said he was burned on the left forearm in December 2006 when handling 114 American-designed M110 mustard shells at a bomb makers weapons cache near Samarra.He said that after the mustard agent splashed on his arm, he quickly rinsed it away by squirting it repeatedly with solution from IV bags. The mustard agent still caused a long patch of redness that took weeks to heal and left scarring, he said.The sailor, who asked that his name be withheld, said when he sought treatment at Forward Operating Base Brassfield-Mora, the Army doctor was not interested.An officer in the unit to which he was assigned  a battalion from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, he said  issued what he called a gag order that forbade him to discuss that he had found chemical shells.The sailors post-deployment health survey, which he provided to The Times, shows he reported the exposure again as he left Iraq in late 2007.The attending caregiver did not recommend further care, but noted the previous order prohibiting mention of the episode. The patient, he wrote, was instructed not to discuss due to mission classification.Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a Navy spokesman, said that the sailor had discussed the exposure with the Navy in recent days and that any previous order of silence was unacceptable.We in no way condone the silencing of any of our service members, he said, and are greatly encouraged that this sailor took the step of reaching out to the Navy so we can get him the medical attention he needs.While exposure to nerve or blister agents can carry long-term health risks, veterans, medical officers and exposure victims said that it was impossible to analyze the new data immediately and predict how many troops who reported exposure would have suffered medical problems. They said it could also be difficult to establish how closely medical complaints might be linked to exposure.They noted that many of the troops encounters with chemical agents could have been brief and minimal, as that of a turret gunner in a vehicle passing briefly through an area where a chemical shell had been used in a makeshift bomb.Moreover, not all chemical agents were alike. The nerve agents found in Iraq after the United States invaded in 2003 were less potent than when manufactured decades ago, according to people involved in many of the chemical arms recoveries in Iraq. Iraqi mustard agents tended to be of higher quality and more stable, they said.Nonetheless, Mr. Carter and Mr. Rieckhoff said that the latest number was probably understated, and that the military should not rely on people who reported chemical weapons exposures to determine the scope of the problem.It should look deeper, Mr. Carter said, at symptoms, such as troops who reported rashes, breathing difficulties or tremors.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:04:37Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/07/world/07iraqchem-2/07iraqchem-2-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 5387}, {"title": "C.I.A. Study of Covert Aid Fueled Skepticism About Helping Syrian Rebels", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/us/politics/cia-study-says-arming-rebels-seldom-works.html", "text": "WASHINGTON  The Central Intelligence Agency has run guns to insurgencies across the world during its 67-year history  from Angola to Nicaragua to Cuba. The continuing C.I.A. effort to train Syrian rebels is just the latest example of an American president becoming enticed by the prospect of using the spy agency to covertly arm and train rebel groups.An internal C.I.A. study has found that it rarely works.The still-classified review, one of several C.I.A. studies commissioned in 2012 and 2013 in the midst of the Obama administrations protracted debate about whether to wade into the Syrian civil war, concluded that many past attempts by the agency to arm foreign forces covertly had a minimal impact on the long-term outcome of a conflict. They were even less effective, the report found, when the militias fought without any direct American support on the ground.The findings of the study, described in recent weeks by current and former American government officials, were presented in the White House Situation Room and led to deep skepticism among some senior Obama administration officials about the wisdom of arming and training members of a fractured Syrian opposition.But in April 2013, President Obama authorized the C.I.A. to begin a program to arm the rebels at a base in Jordan, and more recently the administration decided to expand the training mission with a larger parallel Pentagon program in Saudi Arabia to train vetted rebels to battle fighters of the Islamic State, with the aim of training approximately 5,000 rebel troops per year.So far the efforts have been limited, and American officials said that the fact that the C.I.A. took a dim view of its own past efforts to arm rebel forces fed Mr. Obamas reluctance to begin the covert operation.One of the things that Obama wanted to know was: Did this ever work? said one former senior administration official who participated in the debate and spoke anonymously because he was discussing a classified report. The C.I.A. report, he said, was pretty dour in its conclusions.The debate over whether Mr. Obama acted too slowly to support the Syrian rebellion has been renewed after both former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta wrote in recent books that they had supported a plan presented in the summer of 2012 by David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director, to arm and train small groups of rebels in Jordan.Mr. Obama rejected that plan, but in the months that followed, Obama administration officials continued to debate the question of whether the C.I.A. should arm the rebels. Mr. Petraeuss original plan was reworked until Mr. Obama signed a secret order authorizing the covert training mission after intelligence agencies concluded that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had used chemical weapons against opposition forces and civilians.Although Mr. Obama originally intended the C.I.A. to arm and train the rebels to fight the Syrian military, the focus of the American programs has shifted to training the rebel forces to fight the Islamic State, an enemy of Mr. Assad.The C.I.A. review, according to several former American officials familiar with its conclusions, found that the agencys aid to insurgencies had generally failed in instances when no Americans worked on the ground with the foreign forces in the conflict zones, as is the administrations plan for training Syrian rebels.One exception, the report found, was when the C.I.A. helped arm and train mujahedeen rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan during the 1980s, an operation that slowly bled the Soviet war effort and led to a full military withdrawal in 1989. That covert war was successful without C.I.A. officers in Afghanistan, the report found, largely because there were Pakistani intelligence officers working with the rebels in Afghanistan.But the Afghan-Soviet war was also seen as a cautionary tale. Some of the battle-hardened mujahedeen fighters later formed the core of Al Qaeda and used Afghanistan as a base to plan the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. This only fed concerns that no matter how much care was taken to give arms only to so-called moderate rebels in Syria, the weapons could ultimately end up with groups linked to Al Qaeda, like the Nusra Front.What came afterwards was impossible to eliminate from anyones imagination, said the former senior official, recalling the administration debate about whether to arm the Syrian rebels.Mr. Obama made a veiled reference to the C.I.A. study in an interview with The New Yorker published this year. Speaking about the dispute over whether he should have armed the rebels earlier, Mr. Obama told the magazine: Very early in this process, I actually asked the C.I.A. to analyze examples of America financing and supplying arms to an insurgency in a country that actually worked out well. And they couldnt come up with much.Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said that without characterizing any specific intelligence products, the president was referring to the fact that providing money or arms alone to an opposition movement is far from a guarantee of success.We have been very clear about that from the outset as we have articulated our strategy in Syria, Ms Meehan said. That is why our support to the moderate Syrian opposition has been deliberate, targeted and, most importantly, one element of a multifaceted strategy to create the conditions for a political solution to the conflict.Arming foreign forces has been central to the C.I.A.'s mission from its founding, and was a staple of American efforts to wage proxy battles against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The first such operation was in 1947, the year of the agencys creation, when President Harry S. Truman ordered millions of dollars worth of guns and ammunition sent to Greece to help put down a Communist insurgency there. In a speech before Congress in March of that year, Mr. Truman said the fall of Greece could destabilize neighboring Turkey, and disorder might well spread throughout the entire Middle East.That mission helped shore up the fragile Greek government. More frequently, however, the C.I.A. backed insurgent groups fighting leftist governments, often with calamitous results. The 1961 Bay of Pigs operation in Cuba, in which C.I.A.-trained Cuban guerrillas launched an invasion to fight Fidel Castros troops, ended in disaster. During the 1980s, the Reagan administration authorized the C.I.A. to try to bring down Nicaraguas Sandinista government with a secret war supporting the contra rebels, who were ultimately defeated.After the Sept. 11 attacks, C.I.A. paramilitary officers and Army Special Forces teams fought alongside Afghan militias to drive Taliban forces out of the cities and set up a new government in Kabul. In 2006, the C.I.A. set up a gunrunning operation to arm a group of Somali warlords who united under the Washington-friendly name the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counterterrorism. That effort backfired, strengthening the Islamist fighters that the C.I.A. had intervened to defeat.Its a very mixed history, said Loch K. Johnson, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia and an intelligence expert. You need some really good, loyal people on the ground ready to fight.The progress of the Syrian conflict has only deepened skepticism about the loyalties  and the capabilities  of the Syrian opposition. Years of a bloody civil war have splintered the forces fighting the Assad governments troops, with an increasing number of fighters pledging loyalty to radical groups like the Islamic State and the Nusra Front.Last month, Mr. Obama said he would redouble American efforts by having the Pentagon participate in arming and training rebel forces. That program has yet to begin.Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said last week that it would be months of spade work before the military had determined how to structure the program and how to recruit and vet the rebels.This is going to be a long-term effort, he said.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-10-15T19:59:52Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/15/world/INTEL-1/INTEL-1-videoSixteenByNine1050-v3.jpg", "id": 986}, {"title": "What's become of Egypt's Morsi?", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24772806", "text": "Egypt's ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi is standing trial on a raft of charges, along with many senior leaders of his Muslim Brotherhood movement. The trials, four in all, started last November but none have concluded. The last trial is scheduled for 5 April 2014.Mr Morsi is still in prison. Egypt's first democratically elected president, he was deposed by the military in July 2013 after huge street protests. The deaths of protesters outside the Ittihadiya presidential palace in December 2012. At least 10 people died in the clashes. The Muslim Brotherhood says most of the victims were Islamists. His escape from jail during the 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak. Mr Morsi was one of some 130 defendants charged with the murder of prison officers during the breakout. Espionage and conspiring to commit terrorist acts in Egypt with the Palestinian movement Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Insulting the judiciary. While in office, Mr Morsi allegedly named a judge in a public speech and accused him of overseeing fraud in previous elections. Fraud charges in connection with the Muslim Brotherhood's economic and social programme for Egypt's recovery, called Renaissance (al-Nahda). Allegedly leaking sensitive national security documents to Qatar, which supports the Muslim Brotherhood.How come the democratically elected president was arrested?During his 13 months in power Mr Morsi fell out with key institutions and sectors of society. He was seen by many Egyptians as doing little to tackle economic and social problems.In December 2012, an Islamist-dominated constituent assembly approved Mr Morsi's draft constitution boosting the role of Islam and restricting freedom of speech and assembly. A public referendum also went in his favour. However, widespread protests by secular opposition leaders, Christians and women's groups followed. More than 50 people were killed in January 2013 in violent street protests.Six months later, the military warned Mr Morsi that it would intervene if he failed to reach an agreement with opposition groups within 48 hours to resolve the political crisis.On 3 July, Egyptian army chief Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced the suspension of the constitution. The move followed days of mass street protests calling for the resignation of Mr Morsi, who had not responded to the ultimatum. He was subsequently arrested.Is Mohammed Morsi being tried fairly?Several of Egypt's most influential figures approved the removal of Mr Morsi but there have been many debates about the legality of ousting a democratically elected leader.Mr Morsi's supporters say he and other senior Brotherhood leaders are the victims of politically motivated prosecutions.Only days before Mr Morsi's first trial in November 2013, three presiding judges stepped down at the trial of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie and his two aides, saying they felt 'embarrassment' over the case.How has Mr Morsi behaved in court?Mr Morsi has struck a defiant tone in his court appearances, refusing to recognise the legitimacy of the court and insisting that he was still the rightful president. At first, he also refused to wear court uniform and engaged in numerous spats with the judge.Because of his disruptions to court proceedings, Mr Morsi was put in a sound-proof glass case in court in January 2014 but, along with the other defendants who were in a separate glass case, he turned his back on the judge. Mr Morsi's lawyers walked out of court in protest and the trial was adjourned.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at 11 p.m. ET on CNN.(CNN) -- The U.S. has a 'winning strategy' to defeat ISIS, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff told CNN exclusively Wednesday, adding that he 'can't foresee' sending 'large ground combat forces into Iraq.'Gen. Martin Dempsey also touched on his concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus and what's more to come in the coalition battle against murderous Islamic extremists.ISIS has inched closer to the Iraqi capital Baghdad this week and continued fighting in strategically important Anbar Province.Is it possible that ISIS could gain control of Baghdad?'I don't see that happening,' he said. 'I'm confident we can assist the Iraqis to keep Baghdad from falling.'However, Iraqi forces, some of whom abandoned their posts when ISIS began its assault on Iraq, need more training, Dempsey said. Still, they have 'established a fairly formidable defensive perimeter around Baghdad' that Dempsey characterized as 'a very thick and deep defense.'Dempsey repeated what he said before Congress weeks ago, stressing that doesn't see a need to put troops on the ground in the fight against ISIS. He was firm on the controversial notion that American troops could once again head back into Iraq to fight after being involved in a conflict that stretched from 2003 to 2011.And yet he also told CNN that 'war is discovery' and that if the situation evolves to the point where ground troops are necessary, he will evaluate that and make recommendations to President Barack Obama.There are 12 teams of military advisers in Iraq now, he said.Dempsey said the U.S. got a 'significant commitment' from other members of the international coalition to add advisory teams. Dempsey said the plan is to set up three bases where the U.S. and others can train Iraqi security forces who are battling ISIS on the ground, along with Kurdish fighting forces.He then reiterated that 'war is discovery,' stressed that ISIS is a 'national security threat' and said that airstrikes alone will not beat ISIS though they have forced the group to change 'the way it's moving.'Fighting ISIS is going to take 'patience,' Dempsey said, so it's critical that the U.S. and the coalition show progress soon.For now, 'we're on the right path.'Dempsey also revealed that the international coalition's operation against ISIS has a name: 'Inherent Resolve.'The name, to him, means that 'we need to be able to be credible and sustainable over time in order to accomplish the mission that we've been given.'The chairman put much of the blame for the growth of ISIS on the Iraqi government.Despite airstrikes and international outrage, the terror group is overrunning Iraqi forces and making significant strides in Syria.'We gave Iraq a chance -- an opportunity,' Dempsey said, talking about the war. 'They failed to take that opportunity.''The coaching, and teaching, and mentoring, the thousands of interactions at the local level were all wasted by the government of Iraq that chose deliberately to follow a sectarian agenda and alienate entire segments of the population, which created an environment in which ISIL could return and could flourish,' he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.When asked who in the U.S. government underestimated ISIS, Dempsey said: 'I think what we all probably missed was the degree to which the Iraqi armed forces had eroded and wouldn't stand and face ISIL. I think we all missed that.'The chairman said he has been concerned about Ebola as a global threat for at least 90 days.'I'm worried about it because we know so little about (Ebola),' he said, adding that his worry is stoked by seemingly conflicting information about how the virus can be spread.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the deadly virus, which originated in Africa, can be passed only through direct contact with bodily fluids when a person suffering from it exhibits symptoms.'If you bring two doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room, one will say, 'No there is no way it will ever become airborne, but it could mutate so it could be harder to discover,' ' and another might say something completely different, Dempsey said.He said he is alarmed by the World Health Organization's warning that Ebola cases could increase and the virus could mutate.'Then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem,' he said. 'I don't know who is right. I don't want to take that chance, so I am taking it very seriously.'", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-16T04:10:26Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141015143818-wbt-phillips-dempsey-interview-ebola-isis-00042919-story-top.jpg", "id": 1312}, {"title": "Egypt: 29 killed as Sinai attacks target security forces", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29763144", "text": "A suspected jihadist car bomb has killed at least 26 Egyptian soldiers at a checkpoint in Sinai, officials say.The attack took place near El Arish, the main town in the north of the restive peninsula.

But the command said that it has 'initial indications that (the strikes) resulted in the intended effects.'The airstrikes hit terrorists and destroyed or severely damaged several Khorasan Group vehicles and buildings, the command said in a news release. The military said it believes the buildings were used for meetings, bomb-making and training.The strikes happened in the area of Sarmada, Syria, the military said. Sarmada is about 18 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of Idlib.The United States targeted the Khorasan Group with a series of strikes in Syria in September.Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time.Intelligence indicated that Khorasan was in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in the West, including against American aviation.Sources said that among the devices Khorasan's bomb-makers were developing to try to beat airport security were bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics.U.S. officials told CNN's Barbara Starr and Pamela Brown in October that Drugeon may have been actively involved in these efforts, which also involved technology transfers from al Qaeda's master bomb-maker in Yemen, Ibrahim al Asiri.In July, the Transportation Security Administration banned cell phones without electronic charge from airplane cabins in response to the intelligence, much of it fragmentary, that was coming in on the plans.Drugeon's knowledge of explosives, European background and access to Western fighters in Syria makes him arguably one of the most dangerous operatives in the entire global al Qaeda network.Drugeon was born in 1989 in a blue-collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany, according to Eric Pelletier, a reporter with L'Express who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN.By all accounts, Drugeon had a very normal childhood. His father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed Catholic.He had an elder brother who shared his passion for the French soccer team Olympic Marseilles and he got good grades at school. But like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization, his parents' divorce when he was 13 was traumatic.Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived. He began hanging out with a group of young Muslims in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. Before he turned 14 he converted, changing his name to Daoud.'Drugeon was radicalized over a period of several years. A local imam played a key role. He was part of group of about a half-dozen Salafi Muslims in the town,' Pelletier told CNN.By 2010, Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam. He funded the trips by taking driving jobs. In April that year, he slipped away from France for good, traveling via Cairo for the tribal areas of Pakistan, to join the jihad against U.S. forces in Afghanistan.According to Pelletier, French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as Jund-al-Khilafah, based in the Miran Shah area.Drugeon first learned how to make bombs in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and over time became skilled in making explosives. He took on a new fighting name 'Souleiman' and made several forays into Afghanistan, according to Pelletier.Drugeon is believed to have left Pakistan sometime in 2013 or very early 2014, and to have traveled to Syria to join up with the Khorasan group. A significant number of al Qaeda operatives were making the same journey, convinced that Syria now offered a better sanctuary away from the sight lines of U.S. drones.U.S. officials told CNN they believe Drugeon has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters to and from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:36:05Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141106163904-lead-dnt-starr-bomb-maker-killed-airstrikes-00000618-story-top.jpg", "id": 5938}, {"title": "Why ISIS's treatment of Yazidi women is genocide", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/30/opinion/isis-yazidi-women-genocide/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Dr. Nazand Begikhani is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Bristol's Centre for Gender and Violence Research.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- 'I was hiding behind a water tank in the front yard and saw them killing my father and brother and [taking] away my mother and sister. I don't know anything about them since,' says Dunya, a 14-year-old Yazidi girl.'They put us in trucks and drove us to a big building, before transferring us to a hall across the road,' explains Solav, 19 and also Yazidi. 'Then their seniors came and started condemning our religion and asking us to convert to Islam ... They separated me along with other young ones and ordered us to stay there while taking away the elderly women.'The man I was given to raped me several times and then left me in the room on my own. I was shaking from pain and fear in that hot room, my entire body sweating. Suddenly, another man came and did what he wanted to do despite me crying and begging him, kissing his foot to leave me alone ...'Dunya and Solav (not their real names) now live with their relatives in newly-established displaced persons camps in Iraq's Duhok governorate. They are among thousands of Yazidi women abducted by jihadists during their attack on the Sinjar district on 2 August 2014. Since then, one hundred girls and women have managed to escape their jailers and rejoin their community.According to our field work, which has involved interviews with witnesses and survivors, and based on other reports which have reached us, more than 2,500 Yazidi girls and women were abducted during the attack.The extent of the ISIS brutality toward those women is unknown.We do know from witness statements and testimonies by survivors that they have been systematically separated by age and physical appearance, forced to convert to Islam, and subjected to different forms of physical and sexual violence, including rape and sex slavery.The jihadists themselves have confirmed these acts through their media outlets, such as the English website Dabiq, saying the acts were established aspects of Sharia, because they view Yazidis as heretics who should face conversion or die.According to the spokesman for the Iraqi Red Cross, Muhammad al-Khuza'ee, the abducted Yazidi women 'were taken as spoils of war and exposed at a market for sale'.The enslaved women have been treated like cattle -- complete with price tags -- and trafficked in markets in Mosul in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria. Their 'prices' have varied between $25 and $1,000. They were 'cheaply sold' and mainly given to youngsters as a way to encourage them to join ISIS. Those women who resisted were killed, and some committed suicide.These forms of violence are used as war strategies by the jihadists to subjugate the entire community, to inculcate fear, to undermine community and family structures, and to pollute the bloodline of the population.Local authorities, in coordination with community leaders and activists, have been working on strategies to rescue and care for the enslaved women. These include negotiation with Arab tribal leaders in the areas under ISIS control to help free the women and ensure their safe return to their families, raising awareness, and preventive and protective measures to help survivors reintegrate into their family and community structures.The rescue strategies consist of large efforts to liberate the abducted women; so far, around 100 have reached Mount Sinjar, where they now live in overflowing cities and towns, mainly in Duhok and Erbil governorates.Officials and humanitarian organizations have been busy providing aid and care facilities via a health team of doctors and social workers, but they face a challenge: the level of need is much higher than that local authorities are equipped to deal with.In addition to physical wounds, the women have suffered severe psychological trauma. The situation is distressing and requires an urgent need for explicit psychological as well as gynecological treatment.The international community should take the case seriously and address intervention strategies with urgent implementation measures.Since the ISIS attack, the Yazidi community has been subjected to horrendous crimes, including murder, the destruction of their homes, arrest and kidnapping, enforced disappearance as well as displacement, torture and sexual slavery, and desecration of their holy shrines. As Kurds and Yazidis, they are condemned as heretics and devil worshippers.These acts are categorized as crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, but they are also acts of genocide: they consist of a systematic, intentional and well planned operation to eliminate an entire group because of its ethnic and religious identity.The international community should mobilize resources and establish a fact-finding commission of experts to investigate and collect evidence from eye-witnesses, highlighting sexual violence against women.Such timely data and documentation should facilitate not only the prosecution of those responsible, but also the international recognition of these acts as genocide. The process should also include support mechanisms for healing, reparation, compensation, preserving memories and the reintegration of these women into normal life, including much needed post-trauma support for victims and families after their release.The Kurdistan Region is overwhelmed by the plight of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, with more than 1.5 million people living in camps and others still sheltering in community halls or being hosted by the local population or their relatives.The Kurdish authorities are willing to cooperate with international agencies with the aim of providing all necessary aid to these populations, facilitating the prosecution of those responsible and the international recognition of the acts carried out against Yazidis as genocide.READ MORE: Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS WATCH VIDEO: Yazidi women bought and sold by ISIS", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-31T18:59:27Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141029202938-pkg-watson-yazidi-slave-women-00010108-story-top.jpg", "id": 4439}, {"title": "Sunni Tribesmen Say ISIS Exacts Brutal Revenge", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/middleeast/sunni-tribesmen-say-isis-exacts-brutal-revenge.html", "text": "Islamic State militants have been exacting harsh revenge against an Iraqi Sunni tribe that fought for months to keep the jihadists at bay, capturing and summarily executing scores of its members, tribal leaders and local officials said Thursday.The death toll among the tribe, the Albu Nimr, remains unclear; one account put it at more than 200 based on mass grave sites, though that could not be independently verified. But the reports mesh with the Islamic States pattern of methodical slaughter as it has consolidated its territorial grabs in Syria and Iraq.The killings also came amid meetings between Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Sunni tribal leaders to discuss how to enlist more tribes in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.American and Iraqi officials have said that it is vital to get more Iraqi Sunnis to cooperate with the government, after widespread hostility to the previous Shiite-led administration led many Sunnis to welcome the Islamic States advance in Iraq. But plans to formally incorporate Sunni tribes into the fight have been slow to develop, and many tribes that have resisted the Islamic State have faced brutal retribution from the militants.Members of the Albu Nimr tribe fought for months to keep the Islamic State from entering their area, near the Anbar Province town of Hit, about 90 miles west of Baghdad, according to tribal leaders.But with no support coming from outside, resupply was difficult, and tribal fighters and police officers were badly outgunned by the Islamic State, which captured many heavy weapons from armories in Syria and Iraq. The jihadists finally conquered Hit this month, and have since expanded their control of nearby areas.Each time the Islamic State seized an area, residents said, its fighters made a point of hunting down police officers or members of the Iraqi Army who had helped in the fight.Anyone who was in the state, in the government or the security forces, is their enemy, said Jalal al-Gaood, a tribal leader and businessman based in Jordan.If those targeted by the group had already fled, the jihadists would blow up their homes.That sends a message to everyone else that this is what is coming for you, Mr. Gaood said.One tribe member, Sabah al-Haditheh, said the Albu Nimr had called for military help and arms support from the government in Baghdad but had received nothing.We put the responsibility on the government because they didnt respond, he said. We were fighting ISIS with rifles, and it was fighting us with heavy machine guns.A spokesman for Mr. Abadis office, Rafid Jaboori, said he could not comment on whether the tribe had asked for support.But he said that Mr. Abadi had met with Sunni tribal leaders several times in the past 10 days to discuss how they could be integrated into the fight against the Islamic State.People are of course horrified at what happened, Mr. Jaboori said. But the easiest thing is to blame the government.More than 40 members of the Albu Nimr were lined up and executed with gunshots to the head in Hit on Wednesday alone, according to Naem al-Gaood, a tribal sheikh related to Jalal al-Gaood.In a photo circulated online by Islamic State supporters and said to show the aftermath, dead bodies with deep head wounds lie in line, slumped on a curb.Reports emerged on Thursday of mass graves near Hit and elsewhere in Anbar Province that held the bodies of dozens of other members of the tribe, but photos of the bodies were not released and the reports could not be independently confirmed.Across the border in Syria, Islamic State fighters bragged of executing hundreds of members of the Shueitat tribe this year after it had tried to fight them.And Human Rights Watch said in a report Thursday that the Islamic State had systematically executed about 600 captives after taking over a prison near Mosul in June.The jihadists divided the prisoners by sect and gunned down the mostly Shiite prisoners as they knelt alongside a ravine, the New York-based organization said in the report, which was based on survivor testimonies.Also in June, the Islamic State carried out a similar mass killing of captured soldiers at a palace complex in Tikrit where Saddam Hussein once lived.The barbarity, size and multinational composition of the Islamic State and affiliated groups have increasingly alarmed counterterrorism officials around the world and have become a growing concern at the United Nations. On Thursday, a special Security Council committee that monitors sanctions on designated terrorist groups said in a report that roughly 15,000 fighters from more than 80 countries, including the United States and European Union members, had entered Syria and Iraq in recent months, echoing numbers reported by American intelligence officials last month.The threat is amplified, the report said, by the very substantial resources now available to the Islamic State and its arsenal of modern military hardware.The report reinforced fears that many of these fighters could return home and create havoc.Even discounting those who have been killed and those who have returned, the report said, this is a problem on an unprecedented scale.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-11-04T00:13:18Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 4635}, {"title": "Afghan' in Syria: Iranians pay us to fight for Assad", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/world/meast/syria-afghan-fighter/index.html", "text": "Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) -- It is like many of the images of aftermath in Syria's chaotic war -- a man being pulled from the rubble of the building. But this one is different. The panic is muted, the men dig not slowly, but leisurely. This is because they know he is a regime fighter.'Where are your friends?' they ask, perhaps taunting him. 'Are you from Yemen?' But no, this is something different.As they pull his terrified, tired frame from the dust, the blood seeping from a head wound and pitted against the white coat of silt from the rubble, it becomes clear this regime fighter is Afghan.Video obtained by CNN from Syrian rebels, which we cannot verify, shows this scene and the attempts by the rebels, who are engaged in a pitched battle to prevent the regime encircling the main Syrian city of Aleppo, to interrogate their new prisoner. That's the first indication there's something new here: he doesn't speak Arabic, but mutters in Dari. Facially, he appears Uzbek or Hazara, and is terrified.Their video shows him bandaged up, and on an IV drip. He is locked in a basement and fed, then questioned further. A comparatively generous fate for a regime prisoner in this savage war.It is unclear what happened to him, but he told his interrogators: 'My name is Sayed Ahmad Hussaini. The Iranians pay people like me to come here and fight. I am from Afghanistan and I am an immigrant in Iran. The Iranians brought us to Syria to fight to defend the Zainab shrine. I don't want to fight anymore.'He says he wants to go home, and that he was paid about $500 a month to fight. There are many Afghan immigrants in Iran, trying to find some shelter from the decades of war that have torn apart their land. He says he was trained and then sent to assist the regime.It is potentially a serious development in the Syrian war, and explains in some ways how the Syrian regime has gained ground in some areas after months of appearing exhausted.In the fight for Aleppo, they are fiercely contesting a hill settlement called Handarat, which is itself tiny, but vitally overlooks the main supply road into rebel held areas of Aleppo. If the regime hold Handarat, they can cut off rebel Aleppo from resupply, effectively besieging it. Seasoned Afghan fighters could assist the regime - so far letting the Coalition and moderate Syrian rebels take on ISIS -- in other battles too.CNN sent a photojournalist to eastern Afghanistan to follow up reports of recruitment by Iranian agents of mercenaries to fight for the regime.In one village, four men who did not want their identity or location revealed, said they had just returned from training in Iran. There, they were taken to a police station, blindfolded, and taken to a training camp where they were shown tactics and light to medium weapons.The men spoke in great detail about their experiences and were able to show the Iranian bank cards through which they will be paid their $500 to $1000 salaries a month. Other villagers ratified their stories.Their motivations were complicated. Most said they sought money - a likely motivation as the NATO drawdown in Afghanistan is changing the Taliban's dynamics and reducing the amount of money sloshing around in the country. They also wanted to fight America -- saying that fighting the moderate Syrian rebels the regime is targeting most heavily and who receive U.S. assistance - was one way of continuing this fight from Afghanistan.'We want to go there for two reasons one is to fight against those who are being assisted by Americans in Syria and secondly Iran pays us to fight in Syria,' said one man. 'Those who fight against Assad regime are America's slaves. That is why we want to fight them and kill them.'They said they were former Taliban who had left for Iran after disagreements in the militant group, known for its fractious and sprawling membership.'Before this we used to be part of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but after our disagreements caused tensions among us, we left the Taliban and went to Iran. We are going there to fight. Either we will be killed or will be back with the monthly salary that the Iranian have promised to give us.'Yet their limited knowledge of the Syrian conflict exposed a complex issue over which their loyalties to their paymasters, Iran, may be tested. Asked about ISIS, a predominantly Sunni group like the Taliban, the men said they knew little about them, but 'if we see them in Syria, we will definitely sit with them, talk to them and if our thoughts were similar, we would become friends with them.'That would be one unexpected outcome for the Iranian agents accused of assisting these men.Syria's war has local regime militia, joined by Hezbollah from Lebanon, Iraqi Shia militia, on one side. ISIS and its array of global radicals on another. And Syrian rebels, spanning the width of al Qaeda, to moderates with foreign backing. Syria's chaotic, intractable, and hopelessly unnegotiable war, just got another complex and battle-hardened actor.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-31T18:59:14Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141031123636-walsh-pkg-afghan-story-top.jpg", "id": 4436}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia could aid talks with ISIS in hostage situations, says veteran negotiator  Amanpour", "url": "http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/22/saudi-arabia-could-aid-talks-with-isis-in-hostage-situations-says-veteran-negotiator/", "text": "Saudi Arabia could have a role in hostage negotiations with ISIS militants, former U.N. hostage negotiator Giandomenico Picco told CNNs Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday.Picco conducted many high-profile negotiations in Lebanon that led to the release of several Western hostages in the late 1980s and early 1990s.He told Amanpour that if asked to engage in open talks with the terrorist group, he would have a conversation with somebody in Saudi Arabia.The veteran diplomat also stressed that it was equally important to open a channel of communication witha military arm in ISIS which is actually led by the deputy of President Saddam.He said he would attempt to focus negotiating efforts on that wing of the group rather than on the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who may have been able to catch the hostages, but may be unable to negotiate their release.Governments tend to ask desperate families to stay quiet and trust them to get their loved ones back, but John Foley, whose son U.S. journalist James Foley was brutally murdered by ISIS in August, told Amanpour that he and his wife Diane Foley regret having remained silent.In this country, we feel that citizen pressure may have pushed our government to become more aggressive at a much earlier point in time, which may or may not have helped Jim and the other American and British, I feel, heroes and the hostages.ISIS is believed to be holding several Western hostages and its latest beheading video threatened the life of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig.I think in the future we would look to - enable the press to be a more cohesive force in aiding families such as ours, to exert pressure on our government to use any and all means at their disposal to try to obtain the release of these young aid workers and journalists who are fighting to protect the freedom of speech as well as mitigate unspeakable pain and suffering in these war-torn areas, John Foley said.While some Western governments will often pay ransoms to bring hostages home, it is U.S. policy that the government does not engage in such deals with terrorists. Foley believes that an international dialogue must be developed.This is not a United States problem or a British problem. This is a world community problem. And I'm well aware of the risks taken by men and women in our armed forces to bring these people home. But in the end, I feel that the small amount, relative small amount of money involved in a ransom certainly is justifiable to bring these wonderful people home.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-22T20:19:40Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140912213109-ac-pam-brown-of-foley-and-ransom-money-00013108-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 2788}, {"title": "Pakistan's bewildering array of militants", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29724771", "text": "The sacking of Pakistani Taliban (TTP) spokesman Shahidullah Shahid for supporting Islamic State is the latest sign of divisions in an already fragmented militant movement. Over the years Pakistan's insurgents have spawned a bewildering array of splinter groups and factions, reports M Ilyas Khan.Shahidullah Shahid, as he was known, was the third TTP spokesman to part company with the leadership in recent months.Before him, Azam Tariq left with the Mehsud faction of Khan Said Sajna that quit the TTP in May. Another predecessor, Ehsanullah Ehsan, became the chief spokesman for a group of Mohmand tribesmen that goes by the name Jamaat-e-Ahrar.This splintering of the TTP shows that like any other social entity, large and geographically inclusive militant groups also contain sub-groups.Back in September when the spokesman of the Pakistani army blamed an unknown group of militants - the al-Shura - for carrying out the October 2012 attack on education activist Malala Yousafzai, few eyebrows were raised.After nearly 35 years of conflict involving non-state actors, Pakistanis are used to insurgent groups breaking from the herd to launch an attack which grabs the headlines, often under one of those spiritually inspiring names from the Islamic texts.In most cases, they disappear from the scene just as quickly.The trend started in the post-9/11 period, when elements within the militant network that were uprooted from Afghanistan started to hit targets in Pakistan.These groups comprised fighters from the Pakistani tribal militants, the Punjabi Taliban, Central Asians, Arab fighters and militants from East Asia. Most of them gravitated towards the umbrella militant alliance called the TTP which was formed in 2007.The earliest such group to make headlines was Harkatul Mujahideen al-Almi, which was blamed for a string of attacks in Karachi in 2002, including an assassination attempt on then President Pervez Musharraf, the bombing of the Sheraton hotel and a car bomb explosion outside the US consulate.The group's name was similar to that of a major Kashmir-focused Punjabi Taliban group, but the addition of a suffix - al-Almi, or international - appeared to give it wider scope.It faded away soon afterwards and has not been heard of since.In 2004, a group calling itself Jundullah surfaced with an audacious ambush of the Karachi Corps commander. Then it took an eight-year sabbatical. Soon after it re-emerged it seemed to fall out with the TTP over who carried out the 2013 killing of nine foreign climbers on Nanga Parbat.Jundullah claimed the credit for itself, but the TTP said a specially established unit called Jundul Hafsa had done it. Police in Karachi have blamed some recent attacks on Jundullah, but the group itself has made no comment.As for Jundul Hafsa, it has turned out to be another one-hit wonder, at least so far.Other short-lived groups include the Asian Tigers and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi (LeJA), another group with a familiar name but a differentiating suffix.Both were briefly in the news during the spring of 2010.Apparently, the Asian Tigers claimed that they had captured two former ISI officials and a British journalist of Pakistani origin. Later, one of the ISI men was beheaded for 'spying'.Some weeks after the killing, there were reports of a series of attacks in North Waziristan in which two top leaders of the Asian Tigers were said to have been gunned down by someone calling himself the chief of LeJA.This man himself was killed along with two others by unknown gunmen two months later. The killers left a note written on a TTP letterhead accusing the dead men of kidnapping former ISI officials who 'during their active service had been kind to Taliban'.Make of all that what you will - it's not straightforward.More recently, the group calling itself Jamaat-e-Ahrar (JA) has broken away from the TTP.It is not clear if JA is some kind of successor to a TTP-linked group called Ahrarul Hind, which represented those elements within the TTP who believe in the 'final battle for India' in which, according to them, a Muslim victory was foretold by Prophet Mohammad.The recent launching of al-Qaeda's South Asia wing is seen by many as a continuation of this strand of militant thought.All these groups seem to have grown from a common source - the Afghan mujahideen of the 1980s and their Arab and non-Arab allies who later morphed into al-Qaeda and the TTP.This process was born in the shadows of a military regime that ruled Pakistan during the 1980s and hosted a seven-party alliance of Afghan mujahideen - called the Peshawar Seven - to destabilise Kabul under Soviet occupation.The regime's ideological tilt created room for fundamentalist groups to dominate the Afghan jihad, ultimately giving rise to the Taliban movement in 1994.By 1996, when Taliban had captured Kabul and put an end to the Afghan civil war, the Arab Wahhabi groups and Salafists who had earlier left for Africa, the Caucasus and the Balkans began to pour back into the Pakistan-Afghanistan region, thereby completing the toxic mix that has characterised local militancy in the region.Since 9/11, the number and numerical strength of these groups has multiplied, and many of them have Pakistan - an ally in the US-led 'war on terror' - near the top of their hit-list.Earlier this year, Pakistan's interior minister Chaudhry Nisar told parliament the main TTP movement included more than 35 groups. Later, a security policy document listed around 60 groups that successive Pakistani governments had proscribed since the late 1990s.But there are dozens of others - all vying for limelight and funds.Most of them have local interests. They are natives of the areas under their control, and tend to organise into regional groups to form territorial entities. They are often named after their top commander or their area of operation, such as the Mullah Nazir group, or the Mohmand Taliban.They mostly comprise fighters from Punjab province with a background in the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) which exists to wipe out Shia Muslims. These fighters have links with al-Qaeda and its affiliates, especially the TTP and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).They move in and out of larger groups either due to tactical or operational reasons, ideological considerations or internal group rivalries.Many shine for brief periods, then fade away only to re-emerge in new avatars.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T03:44:01Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3341}, {"title": "At least 21 killed in Baghdad suicide bombing", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/19/world/meast/iraq-violence/index.html", "text": "Baghdad (CNN) -- A suicide bombing in a predominately Shia area of Baghdad has left 21 people dead and 25 people injured, according to a police source with knowledge of the incident speaking to CNN by phone.

Defections from the army have stopped. American and European calls for Mr Assad to step down have grown quieter since August 2013, when America shrank from its threat to bomb the regime for using chemical weapons. Now America is leading a coalition to bomb Mr Assads foes, the jihadists calling themselves Islamic State (IS). It is vindication, reckons Mr Assad, of his long-held claim to be fighting dangerous terrorists rather than his own citizens demanding change.Whats more, American strikes may be inadvertently allowing Mr Assad to concentrate on crushing mainstream rebels. The Syrian Observatory, a British-based monitoring group, reckons the regime carried out 40 air strikes (from both jets and helicopters dropping barrel-bombs) in the provinces of Hama and Idleb on October 13th, double the usual daily number of 13-20 attacks (see map).That the mainstream rebels were not invited to the meeting of the international coalition fighting IS on October 14th (see article) suggests America does not regard them as credible military partners, even though it has pledged to train and equip some of them. President Assad and the people around him never doubted they would win...For them the war was an aggression from outside, says Lakhdar Brahimi, the former UN envoy to Syria.Yet the regime may be more fragile than it thinks. Discontent has been rising, even among Mr Assads fellow Alawites (a Shia offshoot) who dominate Syrias security forces. When a suicide bomb attack on October 1st killed scores of children outside a school in Akrameh, an Alawite neighbourhood of Homs, funeral-goers chanted The people want the fall of Barazi, a reference to the citys governor, Talal Barazi. It was an echo of a slogan used by the opposition.In Latakia and Tartus, two coastal cities near the Alawite heartland, posters of missing soldiers adorn the walls. When IS took over four regime bases in the east of the country this summer, slaughtering dozens of soldiers and displaying some of their heads on spikes in Raqqa, ISs stronghold, families started to lose faith in the regime. A visitor to the region reports hearing one man complain: Were running out of sons to give them. There were also denunciations on Facebook of extravagance in wartime after Wael Halqi, Syrias prime minister, opened a new 30,000-square-metre shopping centre in Tartus that reportedly cost $52m.Another weak spot for Mr Assad is the economy. Before the war government revenue came from oil and taxes on a diversified economic base of industry, tourism and agriculture. Most of these sources have dried up, while foreign reserves of $18 billion before the war are believed to have been depleted. The regime is struggling to produce enough electricity, even though it now has fewer Syrians to provide for. It can afford to pay soldiers, militiamen and civil servants only thanks to funds from Iran, supplemented by shady dealings with well-connected businessmen.For the most part, though, Mr Assads supporters have nowhere else to turn. Beyond Alawites, they include Christians, other minorities, and Sunnis who have benefited from the regime. Mainstream rebels, not to mention IS, scarcely offer reassurance about their future in Syria.The changing international context may be more of a danger. Though Mr Assad does not see Barack Obama as a direct threat for the time being, the strikes have nevertheless unsettled his supporters. Loyalist militiamen are angered by Mr Assads claim that his regime is co-ordinating with America in the fight against IS, given that he had originally blamed the conflict on an international conspiracy by the same countries now fighting the jihadists. For those who doubt that, the regimes lack of response to unauthorised air strikes on their land is a humiliation. Another factor is pressure from Turkeyunsuccessful so farfor the creation of a buffer zone on the other side of its border with Syria to provide a haven for some of the 3m refugees and, no doubt, create a base from which rebels could challenge the regime.The key to Damascus may well lie in Iran, which has hinted that it seeks mainly to protect its interests in Syriaincluding the supply-route to Hizbullah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia in Lebanonrather than Mr Assad himself. In contrast with Iraq, where Iran helped unseat the former prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, the clerical regime in Tehran continues to prop up Mr Assad. Some analysts think Iran may yet reconsider this policy. Two things in particular might lead to a change of heart: first, the rise of IS may favour co-operation with Sunni states such as Saudi Arabia, which funds much of the opposition; second, the falling price of oil, together with Western sanctions, is straining the Iranian budget.The contours of a settlement have long been cleara transitional government and security forces that incorporate more of the Sunni opposition, with Mr Assad in a purely ceremonial role. Yet the likelihood of a deal remain slim. What we have now are only war plans, says Mr Brahimi. There is no peace plan. The Turks and Saudis continue to demand that Mr Assad go. Iranian and Russian diplomats say they have little influence over Mr Assad, who has pledged to fight until the end.Some figures close to the Syrian government predict a breakdown of the regime. I dont see the current situation as sustainable, says one. I think Damascus will collapse at some point. When? I dont know.

It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap.The name 'Boko Haram' translates to 'Western education is sin' in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.As part of its insurgency, the militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.Where are the missing girls?", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T03:59:16Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140512094252-nigeria-girls-boko-haram-story-top.jpg", "id": 1585}, {"title": "Steve Bell on peerages  cartoon", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2014/oct/21/migration-watch-sir-andrew-green-peer-steve-bell-cartoon", "text": "Footage obtained by the Guardian from inside Kobani shows life for the Kurdish civilians living there just days before Islamic State (Isis) attacked the cityA man paralysed from the chest down has managed to walk again following pioneering cell transplant surgerySouth African athlete is sentenced to five years in prison for the manslaughter of his girlfriend", "source": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk", "date": "2014-10-22T01:28:15Z", "top_image": "https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/21/1413930557924/Steve-Bell-22.10.2014-010.jpg", "id": 2480}, {"title": "US security contractor shot dead in Saudi Arabian capital", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/us-citizen-killed-saudi-arabia-riyadh", "text": "Police said the attack happened when the two stopped their vehicle at a filling station in an eastern district of the capital.An American defence contractor was shot dead and another injured in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, the State Department said.The two US citizens were employees of Vinnell Arabia, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, the Virginia-based defence and security giant.They were shot at a gas station and store about half-a-mile from the Vinnell Arabia base, where contractors working with the Saudi Arabian national guard military programs operate, according to Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman.

The council, an umbrella group for Islamic organisations, described its revulsion at such acts being carried out in the name of Islam. Tony Blair, then the prime minister, welcomed the response. By contrast, the MCBs description of the recent murder of Alan Henning, a British taxi driver, by Islamic State as a despicable and offensive act was met with silence from the Conservative-led government. Once the chief interlocutor between Muslims and the government, the MCB has fallen from favour, and so has the whole idea of the government having a privileged Muslim partner.Some observers have been dubious about the MCB since its founding in 1997, saying no group can speak on behalf of Britains 2.8m Muslims. But the MCB did serve a purpose as a transmission belt of concerns between officialdom and the more traditional bits of British Islam. It met often with the Labour government and, in spite of its criticism of Britains role in Iraq, ties remained strong.The council presented itself as a diverse Muslim body. But Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Arab Islamists held a big share of the top positions. From 2006, the Labour government began to seek other partners, especially among more moderate Pakistani Sufi groups who had felt frozen out.Then, in 2009, a senior member of the council signed (in a personal capacity) a declaration in support of Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza. The groups boycott of Holocaust Memorial Day from 2001 to 2007 was also damaging.Critics began to pay more attention to the conservative Islamist groups in the council, in particular the Muslim Brotherhood and Pakistans Jamaat-e-Islami. Sir Iqbal Sacranie, the founding secretary-general, acknowledges that the influenceperceived or otherwiseof such groups has been an issue. Being linked to any one particular group or school of thought limits the councils effectiveness, he admits. But he says the MCB is dealing with that problem and broadening its reach.Defenders of the council point to itsdemocratic procedures; its leaders are elected by the groups affiliates every two years. But these days, when Muslim condemnations of terrorism hit the press they are more likely to come from the Quilliam Foundation, an anti-extremism think-tank that in the past has received government funding and has little traction among most British Muslims. Having the MCB as a clear voice, articulating Muslims views, is still helpful, insists David Blunkett, a former Labour home secretary.Those within the council blame the declining relationship between officials and organised Islam on the coalition government. They resent the belief of some influential Tories that religious conservatism leads seamlessly to violent radicalism. Seeing Muslims through the prism of terrorism is unhelpful, says Shuja Shafi, the MCBs current secretary-general.A row over the influence of conservative Muslims in schools in Birmingham highlights the dilemma. Condemning them would hurt relations with some of those the council represents; failing to do so damages its credibility with others.", "source": "http://www.economist.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T00:04:58Z", "top_image": "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/5605/teg.tdqk/skwo/a&t=subs%3Dn%26wsub%3Dn%26sdn%3Dn%26!c%3D21625867%26pos%3Dmpu_bottom_right&sz=300x250|45x45&tile=10&c=368504163", "id": 1952}, {"title": "UK to fly military drones over Syria", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/21/uk-to-fly-military-drones-over-syria", "text": "British Reaper drones (above) will be used alongside Rivet Joint planes in Syria. Photograph: Ministry of Defence/EPABritain is to send military drones over Syria to gather intelligence in a move that will deepen its involvement in the campaign against Islamic State (Isis), Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has revealed.Downing Street insisted that the flights did not amount to military intervention and said there was a clear legal case for drone surveillance in Syria under the principles of national and collective defence.The Reaper drones have already been active in Iraq, after parliament gave its approval for Britain to take part in air strikes against Isis. However, this will be the first time they will have ventured into Syrian territory, where David Cameron has not sought approval for military action because of fears it would be blocked by Labour and some within the prime ministers own party.In a written ministerial statement, Fallon said Reaper drones would be starting operations very shortly and would be used alongside Rivet Joint planes.As well as their operations over Iraq, both Reapers and Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft will be authorised to fly surveillance missions over Syria to gather intelligence as part of our efforts to protect our national security from the terrorist threat emanating from there, he told MPs.Reapers are not authorised to use weapons in Syria; that would require further permission.Asked why parliament had not been consulted about the use of UK drones to conduct surveillance over Syria, Camerons deputy official spokesman said it was because it did not amount to military action.We are using these assets to enhance our capability to gather intelligence and protect Britain from threats emanating from Syria, she said. The prime minister and government have made clear that we would return to parliament for a separate decision if we were proposing to take military action. This is about intelligence-gathering.Weve also made clear that, if there was a critical national interest at stake or we needed to act swiftly to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, we would act immediately and explain to parliament afterwards. I think our approach is consistent with that.She said the legal case had been set out at the time of the House of Commons debate on action in Iraq, where the prime minister had made clear the government believed military action was allowable in both countries on the basis of national and collective defence.Asked if there had been any discussions with the Syrian government, she said: Were clear what the legal case is and that is national and collective self defence focused on the Isil threat.The spokeswoman declined to comment on the purpose of the intelligence to be gathered or whether it would be shared with the US, which is currently leading air strikes in Syria.The nature of this approach has been: how do we best protect our national security and how do we work with international allies to do that? she said.Pressed on whether it was a step towards inevitable UK military action in Syria, the official stressed that Cameron would return to parliament to seek approval for any such move.This is about looking at the nature of the conflict, looking at the nature of the assets we have, and thinking: how can we best deploy those to support our efforts to protect the UK and keep British people safe?", "source": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk", "date": "2014-10-22T01:29:24Z", "top_image": "http://static-secure.guim.co.uk/icons/social/og/gu-logo-fallback.png", "id": 2590}, {"title": "Bloody and Belittled Shiite Ritual Draws Historic Parallels", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/world/middleeast/bloody-and-belittled-shiite-ritual-draws-historic-parallels-in-iraq.html", "text": "BAGHDAD  The blood oozing from the cuts in the top of Ali Rassouls head on Tuesday had crusted in streaks around his eyes and ears and soaked the front of his long, white gown.But his wounds had nothing to do with the car bombs and urban battles that have torn Iraq apart. Instead, they were his way of commemorating a much older battle: that of Karbala, where in the year 680, the army of Yazid slaughtered Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, and cut off his head.For many Iraqi Shiites who commemorated the death of Hussein on Tuesday in an event called Ashura, the current threat against their community from the extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has profound historical parallels.This year Ashura is more important because of the threat against us from ISIS, said Mr. Rassoul, who runs a womans shoe store and had a long dagger in a shiny scabbard hanging from his shoulder. They have come to kill us, just like Yazid came to kill Hussein.Mr. Rassoul spoke from a street in the Kadhimiya district of northwest Baghdad, in front of an ornate mosque that houses the tomb of a martyred Shiite leader.While millions of Shiites across the world observe Ashura, Kadhimiya is one place where a minority pays homage to Hussein through the contentious practice of self-cutting called tatbir.As the sun rose, hundreds of mostly young men gathered in a street here dressed in white robes. While a few beat drums, the crowd chanted, Haidar! Haidar! invoking Husseins father, Ali. Some waved colored flags. Others carried long knives brought specifically for tatbir.When the time came for the procession to start, Amer Matrouk, the leader of one group, drew his blade and the men, some of whom had shaved their heads, knelt before him so he could give them swift blows to their scalps, just enough to open the skin and start the bleeding.Not everyone knows how to do it, said Mr. Matrouk, 63, who said he has been practicing tatbir since he was a child and had a row of straight scars on his scalp to show for it.He rejected the idea that it could seriously hurt anyone.We have never had any accidents, he said. Sometimes there are those who are not very strong and they get dizzy from all the blood, but they are fine in the end.The practice of tatbir is debated among Shiites and many respected clerics have spoken against it. Some argue that it is a form of self-harm, which is religiously forbidden. Others have written it off as a folk practice, that may have seeped into Islam from Christian Passion plays about the crucifixion or from indigenous mourning rites that communities brought with them when they became Shiites.Still others have argued that it makes Shiites look bad, which is reason enough to avoid it in a region where they are a minority and often looked on with suspicion by Sunnis.These practices used to be limited and no one paid attention to them, but they have started to spread and defame the image of the event in a huge way, said Abbas Shams al-Din, a Shiite cleric and writer during an interview in his book-lined Baghdad home. If you search for pictures on Google and type Ashura or Shia Muslim, you wont see anything but blood. Its terrible!Ayatollah Khomeini went on record against tatbir, and it has become punishable by law in Iran, although some still do it in secret.Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon, too, has criticized it, and his movement has sought to channel the fervor in a more productive direction by holding Ashura blood drives. But other Shiite groups in Lebanon still do it.And it persists in Iraq, where clerics who have spoken against it have faced popular criticism, Mr. Shams al-Din said.There are some who do not want to issue a fatwa because they know that people will do it anyway, said Abbas Kadhim, a senior foreign policy fellow at Johns Hopkins University who has studied Shiite theology. If you do this, you set them up to be sinners.But those arguments meant little to the hundreds of men marching in Kadhimiya, blood dripping from their heads, soaking their white robes and pooling in the street.A woman who gave her name as Um Salah sat with two friends on the sidewalk, thumping her hand rhythmically on her chest as the procession passed.Yesterday, there were attacks and explosions, but we are still here, she said, saying that the event showed the steadfastness of the community.Two of her sons were serving in the Iraqi Army, she said. They never told her much about what they saw, other than calling to say they were fine and making progress in the fight against the terrorists, she said.A short drive away at the Kadhimiya Blood Donation Center, an employee said that many people had come to donate.It can help the wounded person or the soldier, the employee said, giving only his first name, Jassim.But when a visitor observed that the clinic was deserted, he shrugged his shoulders and said, People come.Others wish tatbir would go away.Why do they do it? said Haidar Abu Yassir, a taxi driver, screwing up his face in disgust. Did Hussein do that? No! He was cut into pieces!Mr. Abu Yasser said that he felt that donating was better than letting all that blood drip off your head for nothing.But when asked if he knew anyone who had donated, he paused to consider the question.Nope, he said. They all want to do tatbir.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-06T02:22:16Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/05/world/ASHURA/ASHURA-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 5191}, {"title": "Obama sends 1,500 troops to Iraq  The Lead with Jake Tapper", "url": "http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/11/07/obama-sends-1500-troops-to-iraq/", "text": "Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama is sending up to 1,500 more soldiers to Iraq to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight ISIS, in a deployment that would almost double the total number of American troops there to 2,900.The White House said in a statement that it will also ask Congress for another $5.6 billion to fund the fight against ISIS.

The Peshmerga troops join about 200 Syrian rebels who, according to Syrian rebel commander Col. Abdul Jabar, entered Kobani at dawn Wednesday.Peshmerga troops -- Kurds who defend northern Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region -- are no strangers to ISIS, having battled them often this year as the militant group tries to expand its Iraqi territory.Tens of thousands of civilians fled Kobani and surrounding areas into Turkey to avoid the fighting.What impact will the Peshmerga fighters have?Though the Syrian Kurds will welcome the Peshmerga, the troop movement doesn't necessarily signal a major shift in the fight, analysts say.'In terms of a major war that's of some significance to U.S. national security, the arrival of 150 militiamen to an area is probably not of tectonic significance,' Steve Biddle, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN Wednesday.Most tacticians consider Kobani to be of little inherent strategic interest in the fight against ISIS, Washington Institute defense fellow Jeff White said Wednesday.The city has attracted a lot of international media attention, in part because it lies just across the border from Turkey, giving journalists a clear vantage point to report on the battle there.ISIS is also reinforcing its contingent in Kobani, White said, setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city.But there is some military significance, analysts say.The fight for Kobani continues to give U.S. and allied forces the opportunity to bloody ISIS there, and to keep its forces tied up, White said.'As long as the city doesn't fall, it works to the advantage of the U.S. strategy,' he said. 'The ISIS guys who are fighting in the city aren't available to fight somewhere else.'With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into the city was through Turkey. And Turkey's decision to let the Peshmerga traverse Turkish territory represented a major policy shift.The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population is Kurdish.Turkey, the European Union and United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization.Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Syrian Kurdish and ISIS militants were 'terrorists.' The Turkish government also has bristled at the United States' efforts to parachute weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters.But while Turkey did nothing to intervene in Kobani, Kurds protested in Turkish streets. More than 30 people were killed in cities across the country this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups, as well as Turkish police.CNN's Raja Razek reported from near Suruc, Turkey, and CNN's Michael Pearson and Jason Hanna reported and wrote in Atlanta.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author's.(CNN) -- After several months of airstrikes, the international coalition's operation against ISIS in Syria has failed to dismantle the group's structure of command and has pushed its militants further beyond the country's borders.Civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition's narrow focus, lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider Syrian conflict.Late last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that without U.N. Security Council approval, the U.S. strikes lacked legitimacy. But in comments to media he said: 'Anyway, if their aim is to strike against ISIS, it's OK.'Does this statement mean that the Syrian government views the coalition strikes as beneficial to its hold on power? Does the old Arab proverb the 'enemy of my enemy is my friend' apply to this case and to the reality on the ground?In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime.Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria.Other opposition groups -- including the Free Syrian Army -- are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes.The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories.Although the Gulf states would like to see an anti-ISIS offensive that would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Syrian government, the U.S. and Western allies have made it clear that regime change is not an objective of this military campaign.Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.Thus the Syrian government has found the U.S., Western allies, and Arab states on the side of its own allies Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran -- aiding Assad against one of his most powerful and influential threats.Ironically, the same nations that may have indirectly contributed to the creation of ISIS itself, are now investing their military capital into fighting it.So far, however, the balance of power has not shifted significantly either in favor of the government forces or rebel groups.ISIS has been pushed out of some territories, but is advancing in others.Although government forces have made slight advances in Aleppo, resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes.Strategically, Assad needs to focus on holding the large cities already under government control.More fundamentally, the coalition's anti-ISIS campaign has deflected attention from the Syrian government and armed rebel group's atrocities against civilians.There are claims the Assad government has in fact ratcheted up its attacks in the shadow of the strikes.The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Thursday reported that regime airstrikes had killed 221 civilians, 'taking advantage of the international media focusing on ISIS and Ein al-Arab 'Kobani'.'Syrian civilians might also question why the international community decided to intervene against ISIS after ignoring -- for several years -- the Syrian government's brutality in a conflict that has led to more than 190,000 deaths and more than 3,200,000 refugees.The offensive has not alleviated the humanitarian crisis facing the Syrian people and the strikes' unintended consequences -- civilian casualties -- are increasingly leading to a domestic outcry against such intervention.For some, the question is why the coalition does not address the fundamental roots of the war, tackling the disease itself rather than the symptoms.On a long term basis, the coalition strikes against ISIS in Syria will inevitably keep expanding, working to escalate the conflict.A strategic shift to target the Syrian government's military infrastructure is unlikely as many regional and international state actors have a stake in Syria.Coalition training may gradually improve some of the Syrian rebel groups' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue.Domestic, regional, international and non-state players will continue to pursue their own goals.Amid ongoing instability and competing interests, Syria's social and political environment will be ripe for further radicalization, militarization and ultimately further civilian suffering.In the end, both ISIS and Assad may be the beneficiaries of the foreign airstrikes, using them as a pretext to further advance their political interests.A narrow and short-term counter-terrorism strategy that fails to take into account the many layers of the wider Syrian conflict is unlikely to succeed.Read: Why Arab states are supporting U.S. in SyriaRead: Finding the 'right' rebels in Syria", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-31T19:00:33Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140918110405-syria-rebel-fighter-story-top.jpg", "id": 4460}, {"title": "ISIS subjects Yazidi women to 'rape, sex slavery'", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/30/world/meast/isis-female-slaves/index.html", "text": "Erbil, Iraq (CNN) -- Jana was a 19-year-old in her final year of high school, with dreams of becoming a doctor.

ISIS 'gathered all the males older than 10 years of age at the local school, took them outside the village by pick-up trucks, and shot them.'Among those believed dead were Jana's father and eldest brother.A different fate lay in store for the women.Jana described how girls like herself were separated from older women, then bussed to the city of Mosul.There they were put in a big three-story house with hundreds of other young women. The men of ISIS came periodically, and chose up to three and four girls at a time to take home with them.'These women have been treated like cattle,' explained Nazand Begikhani, an adviser to the Kurdistan Regional Government on gender issues.'They have been subjected to physical and sexual violence, including systematic rape and sex slavery. They've been exposed in markets in Mosul and in Raqqa, Syria, carrying price tags.'Perhaps more importantly, Begikhani is also a researcher at the UK-based University of Bristol's Gender and Violence Research Center. According to the field research and testimonials of Begikhani's team, ISIS kidnapped more than 2,500 Yazidi women.Meanwhile Narin Shiekh Shamo, a Yazidi activist based in Iraqi Kurdistan has compiled the names of at least 4,601 Yazidi women currently missing.In the first month after the mass abductions, Shamo says she was receiving calls and messages from up to 70 different hostages a day. Now, she can't reach a single hostage.After more than a decade reporting on conflict in the Middle East, I was still ill-prepared to hear about the scale of this kidnapping and modern day enslavement.Suddenly, the words of a 19-year-old ISIS imprisoned fighter whom I interviewed last weekend in a Kurdish prison in northern Syria made sense.The young man, horribly disfigured from bullet wounds to his abdomen and arm received during his year of fighting on the frontlines, described how ISIS attracted fresh recruits with the offer of cash and 'wives.'ISIS actually justified its enslavement of Yazidis in its own online magazine.'One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah, or Islamic law,' the group announced in the ISIS publication 'Dabiq.'The Kurdish authorities say they have rescued around 100 Yazidi women, in part through the payment of ransoms to Arab tribesmen who acted as intermediaries.Thousands of women remain hostage. And with ISIS successfully defending its territory from a loose coalition of Iraqi military, Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga, Syrian Kurdish militants and US-led airstrikes, it doesn't look like a white knight will charge in to rescue these poor women any time soon.Begikhani said all of the 100 Yazidi women rescued from ISIS appeared to have been systematically raped, likely by more than one man.The 19-year-old girl I spoke with here in Iraqi Kurdistan was deeply traumatized, and incapable of showing any joy or humor. Her mother and two brothers are still being held hostage by ISIS.Asked what she would say if she met the 70-year-old Arab man who took her home and ordered her to convert to Islam at gunpoint, she says: 'I wouldn't want to tell him anything. I just want to kill him.'Jana says she has given up her dream of becoming a doctor.READ: Kurdish women a force to be reckoned with for ISIS", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T22:57:13Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141029202938-pkg-watson-yazidi-slave-women-00010108-story-top.jpg", "id": 4196}, {"title": "Sinai attacks: Dark omen for Egypt?", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23758941", "text": "For the past three years, Egypt's Sinai peninsula has been growing increasingly lawless and violent - preceding the toppling of President Mohammed Morsi and last week's massacre of his supporters.Although Sinai had always been somewhat unstable, Egypt's 2011 revolution saw the withdrawal of security forces from the peninsula and the release of former militants from prisons.Weapons flowed across Sinai's desert from Sudan and Libya into the Hamas-run Gaza.Traditionally independent Bedouin groups flouted the writ of the government, often facilitating smuggling networks. Emboldened militants, including growing numbers of foreigners as well as local tribesmen, conducted a steady stream of abductions of tourists and attacks on soldiers and policemen.Toward the end of 2011 some of these militants even sought to establish an al-Qaeda branch in Sinai, Ansar al-Jihad. Yet militancy in Sinai remains dominated by a jumble of more parochial groups with looser ties to al-Qaeda.There was no respite during Mr Morsi's short-lived Islamist administration, during which one of the deadliest incidents occurred - the killing of 16 Egyptian soldiers in Sinai near the Israeli border in August 2012.The attack was conducted by one such local group - Ansar Jerusalem. On that occasion, the Muslim Brotherhood itself called on the government to 'confront this serious challenge to the Egyptian sovereignty' and 'protect Sinai from all armed groups'.Mr Morsi responded with a crackdown. This included - to Israel's approval - the demolition of tunnels between Sinai and Gaza.Despite these efforts Mr Morsi was accused by the army of being too lenient, after he released Islamists from prison and vetoed military operations in Sinai.There was outrage when he appointed a member of Gamaa Islamiya, a former militant group that conducted attacks on tourists, as governor of the tourism-dominated city of Luxor.These factors were later cited as reasons for Mr Morsi's removal, although the balance of evidence suggests that he dealt with Sinai much as his predecessors had done.On the face of it, then, Monday's ambush of 24 Egyptian policemen is in keeping with these trends.But violence in Sinai has intensified since the toppling of Mr Morsi, suggesting that events in Egypt's core are closely linked to those in its periphery.Why should this be so?Egypt's political crisis began with the army pitted against the Brotherhood. Some other Islamists, including more extreme Salafists, even backed the coup at first. The Brotherhood was isolated.But the army's heavy-handed tactics and the government's apparent desire to eradicate the Brotherhood are causing the crisis to fuse with the distinct and broader jihadist violence, giving added impetus to militants.The battle against the Brotherhood is increasingly interpreted as a battle against all Islamist currents rather than just one political party.The Muslim Brotherhood themselves are careful to endorse only peaceful resistance, despite the violent reaction of their supporters across the country.But their public narrative - that 'the struggle to overthrow this illegitimate regime is an obligation' - chimes with the jihadists' historic opposition to a military that they have fought for decades and whose return to power they fear.Events in Sinai also underscore that the Egyptian crisis is a regional one.Militants in Sinai can threaten Israeli cities with long-range rockets. Only two weeks ago what appears to have been an Israeli drone strike - conducted with Egypt's permission - killed four people there.Egypt's military has also sought and received Israeli permission - required under the terms of its 1979 peace treaty - to move two extra battalions into Sinai as part of a large-scale military operation against militants, another factor contributing to the heightened violence.This is why Israeli officials have lobbied for the US to resist calls to suspend its substantial aid package to the Egyptian army.American officials are also worried that the generals might respond to an aid cut-off by suspending security co-operation or even allowing conditions in Sinai to worsen. That, in turn, might inflame Gaza and jeopardise the peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, recently resumed after considerable American diplomatic effort.Instability in Sinai has also resulted in repeated attacks on gas pipelines to Jordan, putting pressure on the fragile economy of a key American ally.Sinai may be a dark omen of things to come in Egypt.If the government acts on its threat to ban the Brotherhood, then the group's more radical and violent Islamist counterparts, including those in Sinai, will have a surfeit of recruits.State repression of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950 and 1960s drove it underground and was instrumental in shaping the ideology of the modern, international jihad. The present leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a young member of the Brotherhood who moved from Islamism to jihad in that period.Today, that process would have the added advantages of social media, weak states like Libya on Egypt's border, and the context of flourishing al-Qaeda affiliates in places like Yemen and Syria.The army's eliminationist rhetoric and brutal violence, as well as Brotherhood supporters' own violence against security forces and minorities, could lead to a repeat of that radicalisation.If the two sides cannot find a compromise then more of Egypt will begin to resemble Sinai, and the ripples will be felt far beyond Egypt's borders.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T03:43:07Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/69374000/jpg/_69374771_69374628.jpg", "id": 3301}, {"title": "Turkey and the Kurds: War-war, not jaw-jaw", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21625798-amid-fallout-iss-continuing-siege-kurdish-forces-kobane-turkish-government", "text": "ON OCTOBER 13th Turkish fighter jets rained bombs on rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) thought to be positioned along Turkeys border with Iraq. The attack came after PKK fighters had opened fire on Turkish soldiers near the border post of Daglica. Until early last year this would have been routine news. But in March 2013 the PKKs imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan had said the era of armed struggle was over and that a deal with the government was within reach. Before this week, the Turkish army and the PKK duly held their fire. Are the peace talks now over?Their fate is linked to that of Kobane in Syria (see article). The city has been un-der siege for the past month by Islamic State (IS) fighters as Turkish troops along the border look on. Turkeys refusal to let guns and fighters into Kobane over the border crossing, because it is run by the PKKs Syrian arm, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), has ignited Kurdish fury. On October 7th thousands of young Kurds unleashed riots across the mainly Kurdish south-east of Turkey that left at least 34 people dead. Mr Ocalan promptly sent orders through the PKKs political arm, the Peoples Democracy Party, to stop the violence. The government offered a road map for the peace talks; American bombing of IS targets prolonged Kobanes resistanceand thus reduced the pressure on Turkey to intervene.Mesut Yegen, a political scientist at Istanbuls Sehir University, sees the air strikes against the PKK as posturing and reckons the peace process will limp along. But if Kobane falls, it will be unsalvageable, he adds. Yet ructions over Kobane may be just a symptom, not the cause of slow progress in the talks between Mr Ocalan and the government. The road map contains nothing new. It says the PKK has to disarm. This is impossible under the present circumstances, says Altan Tan, a pro-Kurdish member of parliament. Mr Tan is referring to the PKKs battles against IS in Syria and Iraq. The PKKs prowess against the jihadists, and its secular bent, have turned the rebels into potential American allies against IS. American support for Kobane, though directed at the PYD (unlike the PKK, the Syrian Kurdish outfit is not on any terrorist list), may thus augur future collaboration. Or so Turkey fears.For as the peace talks get bogged down and the PKKs regional clout grows, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is changing tack. Before he was hit by corruption scandals last December, he seemed wedded to his alliance with the Kurds. He was counting on the pro-Kurdish party to support his plans to change the constitution to boost the powers of the presidency, which he won easily in Augusts election.But with tumult on the border and a fear of possible prosecution on corruption charges if AKs electoral fortunes wane, Mr Erdogan is now looking for new friends among Turkeys nationalists. They strongly backed a recent bill authorising cross-border intervention against terrorists in Syria and Iraq. The nationalists include many of the same generals whom Mr Erdogan has long sought to tame.Tellingly, Turkeys chief of staff, Necdet Ozel, has been making hawkish noises. He has called the PYD terrorists and grumbled about being kept in the dark over peace talks. A day after the army bombed PKK targets, the government unveiled new plans to bolster the powers of the police. There is a marked shift towards a security-based approach to the Kurdish issue, observes Arzu Yilmaz, another Turkish academic. The pro-Kurdish party is feeling the heat. We are squeezed between Mr Ocalan and the PKK, acknowledges Mr Tan.Some believe that the governments strategy is precisely to sow divisions among the Kurds. But should it not worry about the Kurds spinning out of control? Either way, the longer Mr Ocalan fails to wrest substantive concessions for his people the more restless the PKK will grow. The PKK may splinter without Ocalan, but it will survive, predicts Mr Yegen. But without the PKK behind him, Ocalan will lose relevance, he concludes.", "source": "http://www.economist.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T00:05:30Z", "top_image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141018_EUP001_0.jpg", "id": 1973}, {"title": "Army: 17 dead after attacking Pakistan troops", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/08/world/asia/pakistan-violence/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Violence has flared again in northwest Pakistan, where terrorists attacked army troops and two militant groups announced an alliance intent on starting a war against security forces.Pakistani army spokesman Asim Bajwa said in a statement Saturday that close to 60 terrorists struck security forces in Khyber Agency, a region west of Peshawar that borders Afghanistan.The two sides waged a lengthy battle, after which 17 militants were dead while others managed to escape, Bajwa said.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.The region has long been a hotbed for armed anti-government activity, not to mention U.S. drone strikes targeting suspected terrorists.The Pakistani Taliban has been one of the most destabilizing forces in the Asian nation.

Their continual existence to this day is a matter that Muslims should question as they will be asked about it on Judgment Day, the author wrote.Their creed is so deviant from the truth that even cross-worshipping Christians for ages considered them devil worshippers and Satanists, the article added.Members of the religious minority who fled the militants advance in northwestern Iraq in August told investigators from the United Nations that up to 500 Yazidi women were herded into the town of Tal Afar in August, before about 150 of them were sent to Syria to be given to Islamic State fighters or sold into sexual slavery.The frank admission by the militant groups propaganda arm coincided with the release of a Human Rights Watch report, based on similar testimony from dozens of relatives of Yazidis still being held by the militants, 16 captives who escaped and two women currently in detention who managed to speak to researchers by telephone.Witnesses also told the researchers that captured men were forced to convert to Islam and that some boys were taken away to be indoctrinated and trained as fighters. We heard shocking stories of forced religious conversions, forced marriage, and even sexual assault and slavery  and some of the victims were children, Fred Abrahams, a Human Rights Watch adviser, said in the report.The rights groups report was accompanied by video of escaped captives and relatives of those still in detention describing their ordeal.They were hitting us and slapping us to make us submit to them, recalled a 17-year-old girl who managed to escape after being taken to the city of Falluja, west of Baghdad.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- It was a surprise, even for a journalist, to be driving down Wellington Street, the city's ceremonial thoroughfare, and to find myself swept into the chaotic aftermath of a disaster. I was rushing to a television studio at mid-morning and passing by the National War Memorial, just minutes after the shooting. A solider was down.Police were closing streets, stopping traffic, barking orders, brandishing machine guns, fingers on triggers. They soon imposed a lockdown, lasting until mid-afternoon. It is from that confinement that I began writing this.This is not supposed to happen in Canada -- much less Ottawa, its sleepy, self-absorbed capital.Sentries do not die on duty at the National War Memorial in this, our season of remembrance. Politicians do not cower in the committee rooms of Parliament, as its Gothic hallways ring with gunfire. Sharpshooters do not take up position on oxidized copper rooftops nearby, looking for men with long rifles.This is Canada, once known as 'the Peaceable Kingdom.' Now we have learned, like so many other countries, that terrible, unsentimental reality of the 21st century: It can happen here.When a gunman killed that lone soldier in front of the memorial today, when he -- and possibly his accomplices (at this moment we do not know whether, who or how many) -- then swept through the front doors of the Parliament of Canada and began firing, something changed here.When hundreds of parliamentarians, gathering in their weekly party caucuses, pushed leather chairs and tables against the doors and barricaded themselves inside their rooms and offices, something changed here.And when the city center was locked down and a perimeter thrown up around the parliamentary precinct and beyond, confining thousands to their offices and shops, something changed here.It is too much a clich to say -- as many surely will -- that Canada has lost its innocence today. Canada is surely not innocent; a nation that marched into the maw of two world wars and left 100,000 of its sons in Europe understands a few things. That's particularly true at this time of year, when Canadians wear red poppies in their lapels until November 11, Remembrance Day.What we might say, though, is that Canada has lost its ignorance today -- and, perhaps, a good part of its complacency, too.This country is now chillingly aware that bad things can happen here, even in the seat of its democracy. Many of us blithely thought it could not, or would not, happen. In 147 years as a democracy, we have never had a revolution, a civil war or a foreign invasion. Abroad, we have not fought wars of conquest, we never had colonies, and we never fought alone. For years, we were the world's leading peacekeepers, projecting the sense of compromise abroad that we practice at home.Ours is an open, diverse society that has one of the highest levels of immigration in the world. It may be we thought ourselves impervious to pathologies and prejudices from home or abroad. Not here. Not us.Then again, why should Canada be immune? Canadians fought in Afghanistan. We are a member of NATO and an historic ally of the United States. Earlier this month our Parliament voted to join the air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. This week or next, our warplanes will go into action there.We should not be surprised. There have been ominous signs. A plot was foiled a few years ago to bomb Parliament and behead the Prime Minister. More recently, there have been increasing reports of 'radicalized' Canadian Muslims joining jihadists in the Middle East.If what happened here is, in fact, an organized terror attack -- and even if it is something less, based simply on religious or ideological fervor -- it is another reminder of the dangers that have always come with a successful if complex society that aspires to a place in the world.Unlike the United States, Canada has little violent crime. It is among the safest of industrialized countries. Murders, even mass slayings, can and do happen in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, its three largest cities. But they're unusual.Ottawa, Canada's fourth-largest city, is a government town. It is Canberra in Australia or Sacramento, California. It is not London, Paris or Rome. It's a parochial place whose mayor thinks that replacing a crumbling public library or building light rail -- years after other cities in Canada have done both -- is a bold idea.So, it is jarring, alarming and sad that this has happened here, of all places. But it was nave to think that a country of 35 million people, on the way to war in Iraq, would not face this kind of violence one day.Now we have. Our long, sweet season of ignorance is over.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:25:35Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141022121346-10-canada-shooting-1022-story-top.jpg", "id": 3681}, {"title": "Flying Blind in Iraq and Syria", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/opinion/sunday/thomas-l-friedman-flying-blind-in-iraq-and-syria.html", "text": "THE Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, has accompanied its brutal takeover of large swaths of Iraq and Syria with the kidnapping and beheading of journalists. Any Western journalists who would dare to venture into ISIS territory today would be risking their lives every second. So the United States is now involved in the first prolonged war in the modern Middle East that American reporters and photographers cant cover firsthand on a daily basis, with the freedom to observe and write what they please and with the sustained presence to offer perspective on how the story is evolving. That is not good.But it gets worse. The Times reported last week that ISIS had one of its British hostages act as a combat reporter in a propaganda video from the Syrian town of Kobani, forecasting that the town is about to fall to militants despite waves of American airstrikes, and suggesting that ISIS was getting even more savvy in promoting its cause by adopting the techniques of a 24-hour news channel.  Hello, Im John Cantlie, the hostage says in the video, dressed in black, and today we are in the city of Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border. That is, in fact, Turkey right behind me. And it will get even worse. Dylan Byers, Politicos media reporter, wrote on Oct. 23 that the F.B.I. had sent a bulletin to news organizations warning that ISIL had identified reporters and media personalities as legitimate targets for retribution attacks in response to the U.S.-led airstrikes.What are we missing by not having reporters permanently present inside ISIS territory? A lot. We cant answer for ourselves important questions: How is our bombing campaign being perceived? Is it drawing ISIS fighters and local Iraqi Sunnis closer together or pushing them apart? How is ISIS governing, running schools and the justice system, and how is this perceived by Iraqis and Syrians under its rule? What motivates so many losers and lost souls to join this jihadist movement? Do we have the right message directed at them? I could go on.Retiring Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns recently authored a piece in Foreign Policy magazine with his parting advice to American diplomats. He quoted Edward R. Murrow, the CBS News giant, advising incoming diplomats that the really critical link in the international communications chain is the last three feet, which is best bridged by personal contact  one person talking to another.The same is true for reporters and photographers. Sure, polls, graphs and Twitter feeds are important. They are one form of data. But interviewing another human being about hopes and dreams, fears and hatreds, is also a form of data collecting and analysis  something the best diplomats, journalists and historians rely upon. You cant capture in numbers a raised eyebrow or a wry smile or the fear in a refugees eyes or the regret in a militiamans voice. Sometimes just listening to someones silence speaks volumes.I often reflect on interviews I did with Egyptian women at an all-female voting station in the poorest neighborhood in Cairo in the 2012 election that brought a Muslim Brotherhood leader to the presidency. Almost all of them had voted for the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Mohamed Morsi. But when I asked why, not a single one cited religion. Instead they said that Morsi would bring jobs, security, sidewalks, better living conditions and an end to corruption  in short, better governance. Morsi was eventually toppled for bringing none of those, not because he was impious.Recently, Vice News used the veteran Al Jazeera and Arabic photojournalist Medyan Dairieh to produce a compelling documentary from Syria, called The Islamic State. But that was a one-shot deal done with conditions in order to get in and get out with your life, Jason Mojica, the Vice News editor in chief, told a panel at N.Y.U., according to The Huffington Post.I asked Mina al-Oraibi, assistant editor of the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat, how an Arabic daily covered ISIS:We have our correspondents supported by a few local stringers who risk their lives by being in touch with us from Iraq. However, we have a blackout from ISIS-controlled areas in Syria, especially Raqqa. In Iraq, our use of phones and emails to get information leaves us worried about the safety of these reporters, and often they are working without knowing how they will eventually get paid. ... Having said that, our coverage is enriched by networks of Iraqis and Syrians reaching out to tell us their stories, in addition to relations with Iraqis, Syrians, and other Arabs who have either interacted with some ISIS militants or had relations with them when they were under other banners.But the reality, she added, is that much of what we know is either from ISIS militants, or anecdotal stories from observers or people with families in places controlled by ISIS.Indeed, ISIS is telling us what it wants us to know through Twitter and Facebook, and keeping from us anything it doesnt want us to know. So be wary of what anyone tells you about this war  good, bad or indifferent. Without independent reporting on the ground, were in for some surprises.

The Kurds won't allow us to see the cells where the prisoners are being held. Their prisoners, they say, are members of ISIS.When the first detainee sits down, I ask the guard to please remove his blindfold. He blinks in the bright light and clearly looks surprised to see a foreigner sitting in front of him.The second prisoner who arrives trembled with fear when he was brought in. I introduce myself to each detainee as an American journalist.'You don't have to talk if you don't feel comfortable,' I add. Each man speaks, though some cast darting glances at the prison guards who watch each interview.A man named Suleiman says he's from Syria, and claims that he was forced to join ISIS out of fears for his family's safety.He says he never traveled to ISIS-controlled territory, but confesses to being part of an ISIS cell that planted and detonated a remote control car bomb outside a Kurdish base in this Kurdish enclave. He believes the bomb killed his own nephew -- and says he received about $3,600 for the job.'They said they were fighting for Islam and justice,' Suleiman tells us. 'They were lying to us. They took advantage of our minds and our poverty.'Read more: Everything you need to know about ISISISIS has seized huge chunks of Syria and Iraq in recent months, beheading Western journalists and nonbelievers as it strives to establish an independent 'Islamic State' in the region.The terror group has been locked in a battle with Kurdish forces in the northern Syrian border town of Kobani since mid-September. The United States and its allies are bombing ISIS positions there, but airstrikes have yet to pry Kobani from the group's hands.Read more: Former U.S. soldier battles ISISThe next prisoner the guards bring out is barely a man. His name is Kareem, and he says he's 19 years old.Kareem tells me he was paid $2,000 to fight alongside ISIS on the Syrian frontlines for more than a year -- and he has the battle scars to prove it. Lifting up his shirt, he reveals a gruesome pink and brown scar on his stomach.'I was shot in the stomach three times,' he says. He also has ugly scars on his right arm from another bullet wound. He claims ISIS drugged fighters before they went into battle.'They gave us drugs,' Kareem says. 'Hallucinogenic pills that would make you go to battle not caring if you live or die.'Kareem says he fought for a year all across ISIS-controlled territory. He says other fighters he was with were promised wives by ISIS. Most of the fighters were foreigners, he says, and he had difficulty communicating with them because they didn't speak the local Syrian dialect of Arabic. Kareem says he even met a fighter from China at one point.Before his capture by the Kurds, Kareem claims he saw ISIS behead many of its prisoners.'Whenever ISIS goes into an area ... the people there who don't adhere to their Islamic law are apostates,' he says. 'Everything has to follow ISIS' way. Even women who don't cover their faces ... women would get their heads chopped off.'The final prisoner was Jaber, a former teacher and father of two who also confessed to a car bombing.I ask Jaber what he would have done if he'd found me while he was on patrol with ISIS.'Your fate would be death,' he tells me. 'And there are different kinds of death -- they would torture you for sure, they might decapitate you, or cut off your hands. They will not simply shoot a bullet in your head.'Read more: Hostage claims Kobani is in ISIS' handsWhen we finished speaking, a guard draped Jaber's blindfold back around his head and led him out of the room.It's impossible for CNN to confirm whether anything the prisoners told us was true -- or whether these men had merely been coached on what to say by their captors.They also appeared to have little information about what was going on in the outside world.One of the men, Suleiman, looks shocked when I tell him that a U.S.-led coalition that includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is conducting an aerial campaign bombarding ISIS targets.'I hope they kill all of them,' Suleiman says, with what appear to be tears welling in his eyes.All three men say it was a mistake to join ISIS. And they are begging their Kurdish captors for forgiveness.But the Kurdish guards running this prison say that if set free, every one of these men would likely go back and rejoin ISIS.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:44:12Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028113932-pkg-watson-isis-prisoners-talk-00020709-story-top.jpg", "id": 3866}, {"title": "Veteran diplomat Robin Raphel's office, home searched", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/06/us/fbi-diplomat-search/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel in October as part of a counterintelligence investigation, three U.S. government officials told CNN.As part of the investigation, Raphel's State Department office was searched and sealed, two of the officials said. It's unclear whether she is the target of the investigation, or what agents were searching for. The officials said it is an ongoing investigation and no charges have been filed.The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post.'We are aware of this law enforcement matter. The State Department has been cooperating with our law enforcement colleagues,' State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Raphel is 'no longer a department employee.'At the time of the raid, Raphel, a retired career Foreign Service officer, was an adviser on Pakistan under a limited, renewable contract to the State Department's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where she administered nonmilitary aid and economic grants. It is unclear, however, whether the inquiry is related to her work on Pakistan.Senior State Department officials said Raphel's security clearance was pulled last month, at which time she was placed on administrative leave. Her contract, which expired on November 2, was not renewed.The officials describe the investigation as a counterintelligence investigation, which typically refers to allegations of spying on behalf of foreign governments. Officials declined to describe the exact nature of the investigation.Raphel, the former assistant secretary of state for South Asia and ambassador to Tunisia, spent much of her career working on Pakistan and South Asia. Raphel was well-liked and respected by her colleagues and often outspoken about what she saw as flaws with U.S. policy toward Pakistan.Raphel's State Department biography says she began her career as a CIA analyst before serving 30 years in the Foreign Service. She retired from the State Department in 2005, but returned in 2009 to work as an adviser to the late Richard Holbrooke, appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the first special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Landon Wilson was a petty officer in the U.S. Navy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers and do not reflect the position of any government or military agency.(CNN) -- One of us is British and the other American. But we have many important things in common. Both of us are in the military and were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. We're both proud to serve and fight for our countries -- and both of us have served successfully. But when our military colleagues found out that we are transgender, our careers took different paths. Here are our stories:British Royal Air Force Flight Lt. Caroline Paige: As a flight lieutenant, I serve as a navigator flying Merlin Battlefield Helicopters with the British Royal Air Force. The role of my squadron is to support the Army: from inserting assault troops, to resupply of austere bases, to escorting road convoys to casualty evacuation, and many other tasks. I am proud of the role my country plays in trying to stem the flow of global terrorism. I am proud of the military and the people who risk their lives -- in Britain and elsewhere around the world -- to do this and I am proud of my own military service.I am also a transgender woman; I have known this all my conscious life, but my military didn't know until I told them after 18 years of service to the Air Force. Because of my country's inclusive military policy, I was allowed to remain in the RAF and became the first transgender officer to serve openly in the UK military, and I have done so proudly for 16 years.It wasn't easy at first, because people fear what they don't know. I set out to prove them wrong by ensuring there was no difference in my capabilities or who I was in my job. When my aircraft first deployed to Iraq in 2005, and then again to Afghanistan in 2009, I made sure I was there. As the squadron's lead tactician and defensive aids expert, I had to lead from the front to ensure the safety of our UK soldiers and our allies.To fly into perilous locations requires that you know precise procedures like the back of your hand, and on several occasions I was at the right place at the right time to identify issues and trouble shoot problems with the aircraft's equipment, earning the respect and admiration of my peers and superiors.My service and performance were rewarded with several commendations for 'excellent service' -- first in 2007 with a two-star award, followed by Commendation from the Commander-in-Chief of Air Command in the 2012 New Year's Honours List. All of my endeavors on operations were focused on ensuring our aircraft had the best possible protection, through equipment and tactics. Had I not been able to continue my military service because I was transgender, I wouldn't have been in the right place at the right time to make that vital difference for my colleagues and my nation.Former U.S. Navy Petty Officer Landon Wilson: In August of 2013, I left my parent command in Hawaii and arrived on the East Coast to begin training to deploy to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. For three months of training, I was 'one of the guys,' and no one questioned my gender or referred to me as a woman. For those three months, I didn't feel like I had to walk on eggshells, and I didn't worry about being outed as transgender.After a pit stop in Qatar in November, where my senior leaders laughed at their mistake in trying to put me in a female barracks room, I landed in Afghanistan, and was immediately put to work. As a junior sailor, I found myself in a place I had never imagined: working as the lead liaison between foreign militaries, such as the British Armed Forces and the Australian Defence Force; as well as domestic governmental agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and NSA. I was proud to serve my country in a mission-critical role.But three weeks later, everything changed: My senior chief pulled me aside and escorted me into the sergeant major's office. In front of him sat my original enlistment paperwork, which listed me as female. Within hours, I was put on a C-130 back to the U.S. With my departure, there was no one trained to fill my position in Afghanistan.Someone must have thought I was doing a good job, because three days after the Navy sent me back to Hawaii, I was promoted and given a Flag Letter of Commendation from the Admiral of 10th Fleet. But at the same time it was promoting me, the Navy was preparing my discharge papers. In March of 2014, I was honorably discharged for being transgender.Caroline Paige and Landon Wilson: After serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, we and others attended the first-ever gathering of currently serving transgender personnel from around the world to share our stories. Some of the 18 nations that allow transgender service members to serve openly were represented at this recent conference in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the ACLU and Palm Center.As members of the military community, it is not our place to tell civilian leaders what to do. We do want to be sure, however, that people understand the main message emerging from our personal stories, and from the experiences of service members from other forces who participated in the conference: Transgender personnel serve just as effectively as everyone else, even in austere environments like Afghanistan.Just like nontransgender personnel, we care about doing our jobs well, so that our militaries can fulfill their missions. If and when our two countries come to follow the same policy, we are sure that the adjustment will be successful.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:14:10Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141023111354-01-paige-wilson-1023-story-top.jpg", "id": 3428}, {"title": "Saudi extremist funding has been stopped completely, claims Prince Alwaleed  Amanpour", "url": "http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/20/saudi-extremist-funding-has-been-stopped-completely-says-prince-alwaleed/", "text": "With the scrutiny of the world on ISISs alleged Gulf funders, billionaire Saudi businessman Alwaleed Bin Talal insisted in an interview with CNNs Christiane Amanpour on Monday that his country has completely clamped down on the practice.Yes, we had a weakness over there, whereby some unfortunately some extremists in Saudi Arabiadid fund certain extremist elements in Syria. But Saudi Arabia has taken very strict rules to stop that from happening. And yes, right now all this has been stopped completely, he said.Qatar has come under the most scrutiny in its alleged funding of extremists like ISIS, as Amanpour discussed with that countrys emir last month.But wealthy patrons in Saudi Arabia have also been under the spotlight, especially now that the country (along with Qatar and several other Gulf nations) have joined the American coalition against ISIS.The clampdown, Alwaleed said, is better late than never.I think we are hopefully doing some good and positive by halting at least the ISIS move now into northern border, the border of Syria.The airstrikes against ISIS are an important first step, he said, but further action will be needed if the group is to be completely eradicated, as he said should be the goal.I think eventually that ground forces have to be committed, and may not necessarily be U.S. forces. There are a lot of surrogate forces that could be used, either the Iraqi forces after you upgrade them, and some of the Syrian elements, the Free Army elements could be used also. And maybe one day Turkey could also join.Amanpour asked whether his country would also commit troops to the cause.Well, I cannot talk on behalf of Saudi Arabia. But clearly the fact that Saudi Arabia right now is involved through its air force and is joining the U.S.-led coalition at a certain time in history, there may be a possibility for that.Despite Alwaleeds claim of a crackdown, it will doubtless be near impossible to stop private citizens from funding extremists, or indeed traveling themselves to join the fight.There is a Quranic verse that says God will not change you until you change within yourself. And I think Islamic saying is very important  summarizes the whole thing.What we have seen from our eyes, these horrendous act of just massacring and killing men and enslaving ladies, and imprisoning young people  that's a big lesson for us, that these people are just criminals.

It points to Syrias bloody civil war as the organizations main breeding ground.Maliki's crackdown [on Sunnis] was a factor. But without Syria, I don't think ISIS would have becomeISIS, Smith told CNNs Michael Holmes, in for Christiane Amanpour, on Tuesday.Smith added that it was around 2011 that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of then Al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to ISIS, sent a few men over into Syria andguerrilla movements need sanctuary and they need open spaces where they can exploit, grow.Some former Obama administration officials have criticized the President for not supporting moderate rebels earlier, so that extreme jihadi militants would not gain strength.But now many of those people, like his Defense secretary, his secretary of state, the head of the CIA, Petraeus, and indeed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all of whom were counseling him, now feel that in fact maybe had we been involved, things would have gone better. But again,we'll not know; it's a hypothetical, Smith said.Smith also made the point that the White House overlooked two crucial warnings concerning ISISs rapid expansion.One was the warning that ISIS was gaining strength in Syria and was threatening to come back intoIraq. They had already taken, of course, Fallujah in January of this year. But we get to June and they're threatening Mosul. Those warnings were taken and received at the White House, he explained.And then there was the warning that they didn't get, Smith added, where there was, I think, an intelligencefailure of some kind. This had to do with the fact that the Iraqi army was pretty much a shell. It had been gutted by Maliki, who had been fearing a coup dtat and had replaced many of the best commanders with cronies, he said.Despite the groups recent territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, Smith does not think ISIS stands a chance of taking the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.I don't see the taking of Baghdad as a real possibility, at least in the short run and even in the long term. It's a Shia city. It's a city that must be more than 80 percent Shia. Militias are operating there in some strength.It's unlike Mosul, that was a Sunni city, he said.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T22:54:24Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141029170009-isis-flags-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 4131}, {"title": "Photos: Unrest in Burkina Faso", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/30/world/gallery/unrest-in-burkina-faso/index.html", "text": "People stand in front of smoke rising from Burkina Faso's parliament building, where demonstrators set parked cars on fire Thursday October 30, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

The move raised concerns about such attacks in both the United States and Canada.Two attackers with some ties to radical Islam, in separate incidents, killed two men in uniform in Canada this week.On Monday, a radical convert ran down two soldiers in his car, killing one of them. Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, a town southeast of Montreal.He exited the car, and police opened fire on him. He died in the confrontation.On Wednesday, radical Islamist convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, shot and killed a soldier, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, who was standing guard at a veterans memorial in the capital, Ottawa. Bibeau then stormed Parliament and opened fire.Kevin Vickers, sergeant-at-arms of the Canadian Parliament, and police officers fired dozens of rounds, killing Zehaf-Bibeau.No direct connection has been found between any of these men and ISIS, though both Canadian attackers had been caught attempting travel to join jihad.Zehaf-Bibeau had contact with other Canadian Islamists, authorities there have said.Official: New York case doesn't appear tied to radical IslamOnline postings attributed to Thompson paint a portrait of someone who at the very least held controversial views.For example, in a comment posted last month to an online video discussing a global caliphate, a user with the name Zale Thompson seemed to justify jihad, 'If the Zionists and the Crusaders had never invaded and colonized the Islamic lands after WW1, then there would be no need for Jihad!'Thompson, a Muslim convert, was killed during Thursday's attack. A law enforcement official told CNN on Friday that the case doesn't look like one of radical Islam.ISIS has a draw on the disaffected and those who don't feel at home where they are, said jihad expert Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group.'The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,' he said.And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine, making expert use of slick videos and social media.ISIS has, for an anti-Western organization, been surprisingly attractive to young male recruits from the West as well as to some young women.More than 100 of the foreign fighters for ISIS in Syria have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates.Canadian authorities believe that 130 citizens are fighting in jihad.Hundreds more have gone from Europe, which is geographically closer to the fight. British authorities place the number of UK citizens fighting in Syria at 500.Thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa. More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia, the largest single contingency.ISIS' global digital reach has terror experts worried about security in the West, especially attacks by lone wolves who may not have any official mission from international terrorists.And incidents have cropped up to support those fears.This week, a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Barack Obama, and then to fly the ISIS flag over the White House.And three schoolgirls from Colorado were intercepted last week at an airport in Germany as they traveled to join jihad in Syria.In September, Australian authorities interrupted a plot by ISIS sympathizers to snatch a member of the public, behead him or her and drape an ISIS flag over the corpse.Also last month, a recent convert in Oklahoma is accused of beheading a woman in his workplace after admonishing women there about the way they dressed.

One thing they already know, though, is that the bloodshed is 'a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,' according to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Here's what we know so far about Michael Zehaf-Bibeau:He was born October 16, 1982, to father Bulgasem Zehaf and mother Susan Bibeau, according to court documents tied to his parents' 1999 divorce.His father is from Libya, while his mother is Canadian, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said.The Globe and Mail newspaper described the father, Zehaf, as a businessman.Zehaf-Bibeau's mother is the deputy chairwoman of the immigration division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, according to her official profile. She's been with that agency since 1990, having worked as a refugee protection officer, legal adviser and manager of operational support, among other roles.'I know that the mother was very caring and a very involved parent. Actually both parents seem to have been,' Janice Parnell, a former neighbor, told CNN partner network CTV.'The boy seemed to have had a very good upbringing. He had a good home base. He was involved in community things.'He lived in several places in CanadaAccording to Canadian media reports, Zehaf-Bibeau worked as a miner and a laborer at various points in his life.Not only did he change jobs, he changed places.Born in Montreal, Zehaf-Bibeau also lived in Calgary and most recently in Vancouver, according to Paulson.One way that authorities traced Zehaf-Bibeau's past was by following his criminal record.Paulson said that Zehaf-Bibeau's 'record indicated infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities.'Specifically, court documents obtained by CNN partner network CBC reveal Zehaf-Bibeau was charged with drug possession in Quebec in 2004. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail.In 2011, he was charged with robbery and uttering threats in Vancouver, CBC reported. He was found guilty of only the second charge and sentenced to a day in jail.What, if anything, does this criminal record have to do with what happened Wednesday?The RCMP commissioner said that Zehaf-Bibeau 'had a very developed ... non-national security criminality of violence and of drugs and of mental instability.'Investigators are trying to determine what role that criminal past, if any, played in Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization and decision to attack Wednesday, Paulson said.He asked to go to jail to overcome crack addictionIn December 2011, as part of a psychiatric evaluation prior to a trial in Vancouver, Zehaf-Bibeau said 'he wants to be in jail as he believes this is the only way he can overcome his addiction to crack cocaine,' according to a psychiatric assessment provided by a Canadian court.The 2011 assessment continues, 'He has been a devoted Muslim for seven years and he believes he must spend time in jail as a sacrifice to pay for his mistakes in the past.'The psychiatric expert who completed the assessment wrote, 'I am unable to find any features of signs of a mental illness.''Although he seems to be making an unusual choice, this is insufficient basis for a diagnosis of mental disorder,' the expert said.A convert to Islam, he had 'radical views'As mentioned , Zehaf-Bibeau converted to Islam about a decade ago. At some point after that, he became radicalized -- though officially haven't specified when or who he rubbed elbows with.Paulson, the RCMP commissioner, spoke Thursday about Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization as well as his 'association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views.'Asked later what he meant by 'association,' the national police commissioner said Zehaf-Bibeau's 'email was found in the hard drive of somebody who was charged with a terrorist-related offense.'What does that mean?' the commissioner asked. 'We need to understand what that means.'Zehaf-Bibeau was asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque he attended because elders found his behavior 'erratic,' a friend told the Globe and Mail.The friend, Dave Bathurst, said Zehaf-Bibeau once told him the 'devil is after him,' and frequently talked about supernatural spirits.'I think he must have been mentally ill,' Bathurst told the paper.He wanted to go to Syria, couldn't get passportZehaf-Bibeau spoke of wanting to go to the Middle East to study. Bathurst, the friend, told the Globe and Mail that he 'urged his friend to make sure study was on his mind and not something else.'More specifically, his mother told authorities Wednesday that her son 'wanted to travel to Syria,' according to Paulson.He applied for a passport, which was 'subject to an investigation,' at the time of the Ottawa attack, the commissioner said.'I think the passport figured prominently in his motives and -- I'm not inside his head -- but I think it was central to what was driving him,' Paulson said.He visited the U.S. at least four timesU.S. law enforcement officials are tracing back Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's travel to the United States and interviewing people with whom he came into contact, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation.He visited at least four times, most recently in 2013, the official said. There's no reason to believe he's connected to any extremists in the United States, the official said.He had 'connections' to jihadists, wasn't necessarily part of a big networkZehaf-Bibeau had 'connections' to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday.According to two U.S. counterterrorism officials, Zehaf-Bibeau was connected to Hasibullah Yusufzai through social media. Yusufzai is wanted by Canadian authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside Islamist fighters in Syria, The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, reported.Other radicalized individuals connected to Zehaf-Bibeau are still believed to be in Canada, two U.S. law enforcement officials said.Early indications are that his connections involved 'interactions' online, including via Islamic extremist websites, a U.S. source told CNN. There is no evidence so far that Zehaf-Bibeau had any 'operational links' to other jihadists, according to the source, who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack.And when asked Thursday by CNN's Christiane Amanpour if Zehaf-Bibeau is linked to a wider network of jihadists, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said 'there's no evidence, at this stage, for us to know that. ... That's something authorities are looking at right now.'He was not on a Canadian list of possible extremistsWhatever his associations, Zehaf-Bibeau wasn't high on Canadian authorities radar when it comes to potential terrorist attacks.He was not among about 90 individuals that Canadian authorities are examining for possible Islamic extremist ties.'Had we have known that he wanted to travel to Syria, and had we had some basis to suspect that he wanted to do that for a criminal purpose, then he certainly would have been' on that list, Paulson said.The commissioner also noted, 'There is no one path or formula to ... radicalization. And understanding each individual's path to that state is the challenge.'He recently came to Ottawa, was staying at shelterPaulson said Zehaf-Bibeau had been in the Canadian capital since at least October 2.During those few weeks, he stayed at the Ottawa Mission shelter, according to residents there.One resident, who asked to be identified only as Brian, recalled running into Zehaf-Bibeau -- who was then chanting and praying -- on the shelter's stairs the night before the attack.'I just walked by and I started singing (a Christian song),' Brian said. 'And it didn't affect him at all. He just kept going.'Perhaps related to his short time there, Zehaf-Bibeau didn't frequent mosques in Ottawa, according to Aymler mosque imam Mohammed Lahlou'We have no clue about that person,' Lahlou said. 'And that kind of person should not have any place in our community.'He is believed to have acted aloneAll day Wednesday, Canadian officials vacillated back and forth on whether Zehaf-Bibeau acted alone. By Wednesday night, they settled on the answer: yes.'It appears there was just one shooter and that shooter is dead,' Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper.He's not connected to a similar incident this weekOn Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was 'radicalized' killed a Canadian soldier with his car in Quebec. That man, Martin Rouleau Couture, was then shot and killed.Paulson said Thursday that investigators have not found any link between Couture and Zehaf-Bibeau.CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, Sonia Moghe, Susan Candiotti, Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto, Pamerla Brown, Deborah Feyerick and Catherine E.

Tunisians, whether we belong to such-or-such party, whether we are from civil society or political parties. We are still calling for this, calling to work together to push Tunisia forward on the path of democracy, Mehrezia Labidi told CNN's Michael Holmes, in for Christiane Amanpour.Although she won her seat in the election, Labidis Ennahda party lost out to its mainly secular rival Niida Tounes after Tunisians cast their ballots on Sunday. She said the outcome was expected.After the election of 2011  Ennahda, and not only Ennahda but many other political parties and especially al-Takattul and Congress, they led the government in this very sensitive period of transition with all problems of unemployment, of development, of also the challenge of terrorism. And in such periods, the power indeed erodes the trust of people and the government, she said.Tunisia, whose revolution marked the beginning of the Arab Spring, is often hailed as the movement's only success story. The country has remained relatively stable since the uprising, which overthrew President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. This was also the countrys first election under its new constitution.We are homogenous on the ethnic, linguistic and religious level. The second factor is the high level of education. Tunisian people are educated people and I think also those - the politicians who are leading this phase of democratic transition are used to work together, Labidi said.Tunisia is the largest contributor of foreign fighters in Syria. Around 3,000 nationals have gone to fight there, according to The Soufan Group. Labidi blames the despotic phase under the former regime of Ben Ali.It was a period where real, and good and positive religious culture was completely banned from our educational programs, from culture. So we have a youth, a generation of young people who have no real reform and authentic Tunisian religious cultures. So they have been obstructed and trapped by speeches of extremism and by these movements which are crossing the borders of countries, she said.Holmes also spoke to Carlotta Gall, North Africa Correspondent for The New York Times and a veteran reporter on the war on terror. She pointed to the economy as the decisive factor in this weekends election.It really was the economy, prices have risen, people are still jobless in many cases and so they were angry and they wanted to show that, Gall said, adding that terrorist attacks also influenced the electorate. This creeping Islamism that people got very scared of because suddenly it became violent, she said.Gall also said that the winning party now has to form a coalition government. They have to form a government with other parties, possibly they will do a unity government with the Islamists but that is going to be quite tricky and going to take we reckon weeks possibly months to negotiate, she said.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:53:19Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028192436-tunisia-election-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 4021}, {"title": "Canadian soldier killed by convert to Islam in hit and run", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/canada-soldier-convert-islam-hit-and-run-quebec", "text": "Terrorist ideology inspired a recent convert to Islam to drive his car into two Canadian soldiers, killing one, before he was shot dead by police, authorities said on Tuesday.Quebec police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform.

The village is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lahore, the capital of Punjab.The province's government will pay the couple's family 5 million Pakistani rupees -- about $49,000 -- as compensation for their deaths, the province's chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, said in a news release.The government also will give the family 10 acres of land, Sharif said.Desecration of the Quran is punishable by death or life imprisonment under Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law.Human rights groups have long urged the country to repeal the law, arguing that it has led to discrimination, persecution and murder.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it sent a team to the village, and that the team 'did not come across any evidence of desecration of the Holy Quran.'The commission said that the couple had three young children -- two sons and a daughter -- and also indicated that the slain woman was pregnant.But a postmortem examination later revealed no evidence that she was pregnant, CNN affiliate GEO News reported.Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law often is used to settle personal vendettas, rights groups say, and people accused of the committing the crime are frequently targeted by mob violence.That, according to the HRCP, appeared to be the situation in Kot Radha Kishan, and that the incident stemmed with a dispute over money the kiln's owners said the couple owed them.An accusation that the couple had desecrated the Quran 'was spread to nearby villages and announcements (were) made through mosque loudspeakers,' the HRCP said.The mob that went to the kiln was estimated at around 500 people, the rights group said, citing local police.The HRCP said its team learned that four policemen went to the kiln to demand that the couple be handed over for protection from the mob, but that the owners 'instructed their employees not to hand the couple over and the policemen were also beaten up.'The kiln's owners were among those arrested, the rights group said, quoting police.Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Hilary Whiteman wrote from Hong Kong; Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

The BBC profiles the suspected gunman, widely identified as 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.Canadian police say Zehaf-Bibeau was a Canadian-born petty criminal who may also have held Libyan citizenship.Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) commissioner Bob Paulson said on Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had recently applied for a new passport, and authorities now believe he intended to go to Syria.'The passport was part of his motivation,' he told a press conference.'His application was not rejected. His passport was not revoked. He was waiting to get it and there was an investigation going on to determine to see whether he would get a passport.'Mr Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau was not among 90 individuals known to Canadian security forces as a 'high-risk traveller' - contrary to initial reports.Nor was he linked to the Muslim-convert who on Monday killed a Canadian soldier in Quebec in a hit-and-run attack.Mr Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau's criminal records were related to drugs, violence and 'other criminal activities'.He said police were trying to piece together how Zehaf-Bibeau acquired a Winchester lever-action shotgun, as he was banned from owning firearms due to his criminal convictions.Mr Paulson added that Zehaf-Bibeau's email address had been found in the computer hard-drive of someone charged with a 'terrorist-related offence', but he did not give details.Court documents show Zehaf-Bibeau was convicted of several petty crimes during the early 2000s, spending several days in jail.He was charged in Quebec for crimes including credit card fraud and multiple counts of drugs possession.In Vancouver in 2011 he was also charged with robbery and making threats. A psychiatric assessment at the time considered him fit to stand trial.Zehaf-Bibeau grew up in Laval, a city north of Montreal in Quebec.Neighbours of his family told broadcaster CBC that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau had been 'a sweet boy', and that they were shocked by the news.Canadian media said his father, Bulgasem Zehaf, was originally from Libya and ran a cafe in Montreal. His mother, Susan Bibeau, worked at Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board. The two were said to have divorced in 1999.They released a joint statement on Thursday saying 'no words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time'.They said they were 'so sad' that Cpl Nathan Cirillo, the soldier shot at the National War Memorial, had lost his life and apologised for the 'pain, fright and chaos' their son created.Susan Bibeau wrote that they had 'no explanation to offer', saying she spoke to her son over lunch last week having not seen him for more than five years.Police said they seized items belonging to Zehaf-Bibeau from the Ottawa Mission, a homeless shelter, late on Wednesday.The mission's residents told CBC News that he had been seen frequently at the mission over the last two weeks.Shelter resident John Clothier told CBC that Zehaf-Bibeau was 'desperately' trying to buy a car because his old one had broken down.'People were trying to help him, but we didn't understand what he was up to,' Mr Clothier said. 'He acted bizarre, he did. Very bizarre.'Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail spoke to Dave Bathurst, who said he had become friends with the suspect after they met in a mosque three years ago.Mr Bathurst said his friend did not appear to have extremist views at first, but had displayed some 'erratic' behaviour.'We were having a conversation in a kitchen, and I don't know how he worded it: he said the devil is after him,' Mr Bathurst said.

A former CNN producer and correspondent, she is the author of 'The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television.' Follow her on Twitter @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- Just when you thought it was impossible for ISIS to become any more contemptible, the group in its latest publication boasts of its success in bringing the return of slavery. More specifically, it announced and provided elaborate justification for the enslavement of women.We didn't need a new propaganda effort from the self-appointed Islamic State to know the nightmare that has befallen women in territories captured by its fighters. Now we've had a look at the twisted logic that rationalizes sexual exploitation, killing and enslavement of women and young girls.Is it any wonder then that women in Iraq and Syria have moved to the forefront of the war against ISIS? They have taken up arms, organized civil protests and warned the world about the threat that ISIS poses.A woman is leading Kurdish forces fighting ISIS in the city of Kobani, Syria. And a substantial number -- more than one third -- of the Kurdish battlefield troops in Syria are women.One reason they fight is that women have more to lose than anyone else.For a time, the rumors seemed so extreme, so outlandish, that they were met with a dose of skepticism: Talk of slave markets, mass kidnappings, women treated as spoils of war distributed among the victorious fighters, sounded like tales from a historic account, not of a 21st-century conflict.But in 2014, using the Internet, ISIS described what it did with members of Iraq's Yazidi minority: 'After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to Sharia amongst the fighters of the Islamic State. ...' The explanation included 'scholarly analysis' to justify the religious logic and social benefits of reviving the slavery of women. 'One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia, or Islamic law.'It seems pointless to discuss religious doctrine with a group determined to kill its way into the imposition of seventh-century norms more than 1,400 years after they were written. A number of top Muslim clerics have rejected ISIS' interpretation of Islamic law. And some Muslims argue the Quran is actually egalitarian.ISIS, in contrast, finds slavery and the holding of concubines a beneficial practice, writing that 'a number of contemporary scholars' say the end of slavery has led to an increase in 'adultery, fornication, etc.'The latest publication confirms what human rights investigators and survivors of ISIS have reported. The United Nations says slave markets now operate in Raqqa, the ISIS 'capital' in Syria, and in Mosul, until recently a modern city in Iraq.U.N. investigators interviewed witnesses, who told of women taken captive by ISIS, sexually abused and handed to slave traders. The United Nations estimates there are at least 2,500 victims. Others say the number may be much higher.When Kurdish forces recaptured Mosul Dam, they reportedly said they found a woman naked and tied up, who had been raped repeatedly by ISIS men. Similar reports have come from other ISIS-controlled areas.Just like the publicized beheading of captives has a strategic purpose, the treatment of women as battlefield loot is a way of enticing new recruits.But it is also a powerful motivation for women to join the fight.In the battle over Kobani, just across the border from Turkey, ground troops are led by two top officers of the YPG, the Kurdish People's Protection Units. One of them is a woman, Mayssa Abdo, known in the battlefield as Narin Afrin. About 35% of YPG's forces are women. Then there is YPJ, the Women's Protection Unit, counting 7,500 uniformed fighters, some barely bigger than their rifles. Kurdish women from Turkey have volunteered to fight alongside their Kurdish brethren in Syria.Inside Mosul, women organized resistance against ISIS' oppressive rule. The women's rights activist Sameera Salih al-Nuaimy denounced ISIS atrocities on social media. She was arrested, tortured and executed by an ISIS firing squadWomen physicians in Mosul organized a strike when ISIS ordered them to cover their faces. At least one of the strikers was executed, as have been countless female lawyers, doctors and other professional women.A turning point in global attention to the threat posed by ISIS came in August, when a woman, a Yazidi legislator, took the floor in the Iraqi parliament, saying ISIS was committing genocide against Iraq's Yazidis. 'Mr. Speaker,' cried out Vian Dakhil, the only Yazidi member of parliament, 'We are being slaughtered. We are being exterminated.'Since then, while the United States helped save thousands of Yazidis and started bombing ISIS without putting 'boots on the ground,' countless women, mostly Kurdish, have laced up their boots and headed to the battlefield.The worst of ISIS treatment is reserved for 'infidels,' or for those defying their orders. In areas under ISIS control, women are required to observe strict clothing rules and are not allowed to leave the house without a male relative. Violators can be whipped or even executed. It's worth remembering that many of the women facing these restrictions had been living modern lives.Just when it seemed ISIS could not be more offensive and threatening, it has provided everyone, especially, women even more reasons to fight back.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-10-15T04:59:39Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141014151105-05-syria-1014-story-top.jpg", "id": 770}, {"title": "Blast near ATM in Nigeria kills 10, witnesses say", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/07/world/africa/nigeria-violence/index.html", "text": "Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- An explosion near a bank killed at least 10 people in northeastern Nigeria on Friday, witnesses and rescue volunteers said.People were lined up at an ATM outside a bank on the outskirts of the town of Azare when the explosion happened, witnesses said.Several other people were injured.

As was Martin Rouleau Couture, the man who ran over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec. As was Zale Thompson, who attacked four police officers in Queens, New York, also last week. It's why I have said before -- we have to be honest, there is a problem in the world of Islam today.Some people have found in it an ideology of opposition and violence against the modern and Western world. The three jihadis who burst onto the news last week represent that ugly phenomenon. But let's dip deeper into these three people to understand what moved them to become terrorists.None of them was born and brought up a religious Muslim. A profile of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in The New York Times suggests someone who went from a life of partying as a 16-year-old to repeated arrests for drug possession and stealing a credit card. He was once sentenced to prison for two years for possessing a weapon in a robbery. In the Times article, one of the counselors at a Salvation Army shelter described his battles with addiction thus: 'He was doing heroin to take the edge off crack.'Amidst this turmoil, the Times says, he converted to Islam, got radicalized, sought to go to Syria to fight in the jihad and finally ended up trying to wage his own version of it in Ottawa and died after killing a soldier.The man who ran over the soldiers in Canada last week reportedly converted to Islam only a year ago.The New York Police Department says the man who attacked its officers with a hatchet, also clearly disturbed, converted to Islam two years ago.These are not people steeped in Islam -- people for whom the religion has shaped their worldview over decades, people who were motivated by their immersion in the religion.On the contrary, these were unstable young men, prone toward radicalism and violence. They were searching for an ideology that would fit their disturbed worldview, and in the radical and jihadi interpretations of Islam, they found it.It is always worth remembering that these people represent a tiny minority. After all, think of it this way: Terror groups such as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and al Qaeda have been calling on Muslims to engage in terrorism in Western cities for over 10 years now. But of the some 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, the number who have responded to these calls is a small, small, small percentage.If all Muslims were radicals, we would have more than three to worry about last week.And yet, there is a problem within Islam.It is not enough for Muslims to point out that these people do not represent the religion. They don't. But Muslims need to take more active measures to protest these heinous acts.They also need to make sure that Muslim countries and societies do not in any way condone extremism, anti-modern attitudes and intolerance towards other faiths.Muslims are right to complain that there is anti-Muslim bigotry out there. But they would have a more persuasive case if they took on some of the bigotry within the world of Islam as well.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:51:50Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141026111426-exp-gps-1026-take-00002820-story-top.jpg", "id": 3982}, {"title": "Turkey: ISIS-Kurdish fight on border stirs trouble", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/20/world/meast/turkey-isis/index.html", "text": "Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey made a significant policy shift Monday when it announced it would allow Kurdish Peshmerga fighters from northern Iraq to travel through the Turkish territory to reinforce the besieged Kurdish town of Kobani in northern Syria.The announcement was all the more striking, because earlier this month Turkey's President equated the Kurdish militants defending Kobani to the ISIS fighters who were laying siege to the town. Both the Kurdish and ISIS militants are, in the words of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 'terrorists.''Turkey feels like it has fallen into the subway tracks and is surrounded by live rails,' said Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, a conflict mediation organization. 'It is very difficult for Turkey to make any choice.'Turkey to let Iraqi Kurds use its territory to reinforce KobaniTurkey's historically troubled relations with its own ethnic Kurdish population is one reason Ankara balked at joining the U.S.-led coalition bombing the militants who call themselves the Islamic State.But Turkey's noninterference policy came at a cost.The scenes of Kurdish and ISIS fighters locked in a death struggle on the border, as well as the images of more than 100,000 desperate Syrian Kurds fleeing to Turkish territory, triggered spasms of deadly violence between rival factions within Turkey.Kurdish politicians in Turkey accused the Turkish government of siding with ISIS by refusing to arm Kobani's defenders. Kurds then took to the streets in protest.More than 30 people were killed in cities around Turkey this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups as well as Turkish police.'All of these constituencies are getting fired up by the scenes on television that they're seeing in the Middle East,' said Pope of the International Crisis Group. 'This has led for the first time in 20 years to gangs taking to the streets and killing each other.'On Friday, the battle for Kobani was felt at one of Turkey's most elite institutions, Bogazici University.On a leafy campus overlooking Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait, friends, relatives and fellow academics gathered to remember a 30-year old sociologist named Suphi Nejat Agirnasli.Agirnasli, a member of Turkey's Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, was reported killed this month in Kobani after he volunteered to join Kurdish militants defending the city.Mourners waved red communist flags and chanted 'ISIS killers' as they marched carrying Agirnasli's portrait through the usually peaceful campus.Agirnasli's death shocked some Turks, who have felt Turkey's largest city was somehow insulated from the turmoil in the Middle East.'I never thought that someone from our university would actually go there and get killed,' said Suveyda Cil, 19, a Bogazici student. 'I never thought I was so close to these situations because it's so far from Istanbul, but now it's so close.'One of Agirnasli's professors said he understood why his former student volunteered to fight alongside the Kurds, even though Agirnasli wasn't a Kurd.'What's going on in Kobani today is basically kind of a struggle against barbarians ... against people who have no sense of humanity,' said Zafer Yenal, the head of Bogazici's sociology department. 'Probably (Suphi) Nejat was very shocked. He basically saw this and wanted to be there in some capacity.'An estimated 20% of Turkey's population is made up of ethnic Kurds. Historically, the Turkish government has persecuted and marginalized this community, referring to them for years as 'mountain Turks.'In 1984, a group of Marxist-inspired guerrillas calling themselves the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, began fighting an insurgent war against the Turkish state. The conflict would ebb and flow for the next 30 years.The PKK initially fought to carve an independent Kurdistan out of Kurdish-populated regions of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. But the bulk of the bloodshed took place in southeastern Turkey, resulting in the deaths of more than 30,000 people over three decades.The PKK was accused of assassinating teachers, police officers and rival Kurdish activists. Meanwhile, the Turkish security forces demolished hundreds of Kurdish villages in an attempt to destroy support for the separatists.The United States and European Union joined their NATO ally Turkey in labeling the PKK a terrorist organization.Since coming to power in Turkey some 12 years ago, Erdogan pushed to open peace talks with the PKK. Meanwhile, the PKK has dropped its demands for an independent state, instead calling for greater autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights within Turkey.'This peace process is one of the only good things happening in the Middle East today,' Pope said.But the Kobani-related violence inside Turkey has threatened to derail the peace process.Complicating matters further is that ISIS has found some support within Turkey's majority Muslim society.Hundreds of Turks are believed to have joined the movement.Some appeared in propaganda videos urging their countrymen to join ISIS' ranks.'We have come here to Syria for jihad to practice God's religion, to practice jihad on God's path, and to gain God's sustenance to, God willing, go to his heaven,' one bearded man holding a machine gun told the camera in Turkish.Another unnamed Turkish militant explained in a video why he left his three children behind in Istanbul to join ISIS in Syria.'When the children are dying here, my conscience did not let me stay and love my children. If you come here, there is dignity, honor, everything is here,' the man said. 'Instead of staying in Turkey and living in contempt, standing guard here for one night would be better for you.'ISIS supporters have emerged on at least one Istanbul university campus.On September 26, students filmed more than 10 men wearing masks and carrying clubs yelling, 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is great'), in the literature department at Istanbul University. The video then showed these Islamist students attacking leftist students who had been protesting against ISIS.The International Crisis Group's Pope said that when it comes to ISIS 'there's a conflicted feeling in Turkey. There's a condemnation of the methods. At the same time there's a sympathy for the cause.'One Turk strongly sympathizing with ISIS is Ali Osman Zor, a self-described 'Islamic revolutionary' and enthusiastic member of the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front.Zor, who spent several years in prison on terrorism convictions, now edits a magazine published in Istanbul that endorses ISIS.In an interview with CNN, Zor said he supported ISIS' violent methods, arguing they were a natural response to what he claimed were decades of Western imperialism in the Middle East as well as Kurdish and Shiite Muslim persecution of Sunni Muslims in Iraq.'We saw one man killed,' Zor said, referring to the multiple beheadings and executions ISIS militants filmed on camera and distributed over social media.'What about all the people killed by U.S. airstrikes?

We don't really want to broadcast it; we don't want to go to the media and talk about what we did for the Iraqis. But in practice, we defended them.The head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, has even been photographed on the ground in Iraq.Terrorists cannot be destroyed by bombing them. You cannot solve terrorism by occupation. And in order to fight them effectively, you have to choose another method. And you know that we have good experience in that, because we have actually fought against them.Larijani declined to elaborate on what that method would be, saying it would tip off ISIS.Iran and the United States have found themselves to be odd allies in the fight against ISIS, but they differ on strategy. President Rouhani told Amanpour last month that the U.S.-led strikes were mere theater.Some have been calling American troops to once again intervene on the ground in Iraq.Part of it can be a ground operation, Larijani said. And the people who are going to be there on the ground should be skillful enough. And these people should not be like mercenaries; they need to have enough motivation to do that.Iraqis and Syrians themselves are capable enough to carry out such operations themselves.America, he said, should concern itself more with making sure that financial and military support does not find its way to ISIS; several Gulf countries, such as Qatar and Bahrain, have been accused of funnelling support to extremist groups.ISIS was not a group that was created on its own. We have to get to the root causes, and we have to know that big powers were responsible for its creation and also some countries of the region.Fighting terrorism is not child's play. It can be very costly.Figuring out a way forward in the ISIS fight is not the only area in which Iran and the United States must a way forward; a November deadline is also looming for negotiations to bring a permanent deal on Irans nuclear program, which have been ongoing for nearly a year.President Rouhani on Monday said on Iranian television Monday that a nuclear settlement is certain, according to Reuters.I think it is quite possible, Larijani said. Of course, this [is] providing that both sides are serious enough about reaching a deal.I think the remaining issues, or the outstanding issues, can be resolved by that deadline, November twenty fourth.Even as Iran seems to open up to the world under President Rouhani, the country is still responsible for jailing dozens of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and activists.One of those is Washington Post reported Jason Rezaian, who has been in custody since July. His wife, who was being held with him, was recently released.According to the rules and the laws in Iran, the charges cannot be publicly announced before an investigation is done, Larijani said. As far as I know, there are some charges against this person, but they have not yet been made public because of those laws I told you about. But his case is being processed as we speak.Also being held is the activist Ghoncheh Ghavami, who is reportedly on hunger strike, after - according to Amnesty International - attempting to attend a volleyball game, which is an activity reserved for men.There should be no doubt that we don't want to send anybody to jail with no good reason. As far as I know, there has been an investigation opened into the case. And I hope that this will come to an end and be concluded as soon as possible.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-15T02:09:16Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141010233154-anbar-iraq-isis-isil-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 249}, {"title": "3 girls skipped school to sneak off and join ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/us/colorado-teens-syria-odyssey/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- The first indication that something was wrong was a phone call from his daughter's Denver area school to let Assad Ibrahim know that she had not come to class.He dialed her cell. And she answered. But, officials say, she didn't tell him that she was on her way to Syria to join ISIS.She was just late for class, that's all, Ibrahim's daughter told him on Friday, according to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, which filed a runaway report.The American girl of Sudanese descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends, Americans of Somali descent, who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany.Those two had told their father, Ali Farah, that they were going to the library.But when Farah got home from work, a visitor came calling, according to the documents. Apparently, it was Ibrahim.Farah should check to see if his daughters' passports were missing, the visitor told him -- just like his daughter's passport was.Sure enough, they were gone, along with $2,000 in cash.The two families called the FBI. They said they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey.The agency put out a notice on their passports.German authorities intercepted the trio, ages 15, 16 and 17, at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States, where they were greeted by FBI agents.The three girls were questioned and released. Two U.S. officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Out of the blueThe girls' parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel. None of them had ever run away before.Their disappearance hit them out of the blue, the way other ISIS related incidents are popping up in the Western world. Two more turned up in tandem with the girls' runaway attempt.On Monday, a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car, killing one of them. Martin Rouleau Couture, 25, then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, southeast of Montreal.He exited the car, and police shot him dead.Back in July, Couture, too, had tried to join foreign jihad, and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey. But they could not charge him and had to let him go.And this week, a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Obama, then fly the ISIS flag over the White House.ISIS has, for an anti-Western organization, been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West, as well as to some young women.More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates; hundreds more from Europe, which is geographically closer to the fight.Every week, five more people from the UK alone join ISIS, a British police commissioner said Tuesday. And that's a conservative estimate.'We know that over 500 British nationals traveled to join the conflict,' said Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe from the Metropolitan Police.'Five a week doesn't sound much, but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50% more than we think have gone already,' he said.To put things into perspective, though, thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa. More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia.It's more than just a radical interpretation of Islam that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group, a former CIA officer says.'They're often times searching for an identity, because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative, which is: Your people (Muslims) are being oppressed in this place called Syria; your government is doing nothing; we're the only ones who are actually going to help you out,' said Aki Peritz. 'Why don't you join the fight?'Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live, and they believe ISIS can give it to them.'The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,' he says.And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine, making expert use of slick videos and social media.ISIS' global digital reach has terror experts in the United States worried about security at home as well.There are terrorist groups in Yemen and in Syria with stated ambitions of striking on American soil, but another threat is more probable, says counterterrorism expert Matt Olsen.'I would say the most likely types of attack is one of these homegrown violent extremists or lone offenders in the United States, and (with) the rise of ISIS and the number of people going to Syria...the likelihood does go up.'Self-styled attackers like the Boston Marathon bombers could be the result.The use of the Internet makes terrorists more vulnerable to tracking, but that has become more difficult since Edward Snowden revealed secret U.S. surveillance programs.In Denver, the 17-year-old girl was apparently the instigator of the trip, having planned it for months, two U.S. officials said.But all three researched the plan online, visiting websites where extremists discuss how to get to Syria. The online activity didn't set off any tripwires the FBI typically uses to flag possible jihadist sympathizers, the officials said.The FBI is combing all of their communications to see if anyone was helping them. Their parents think ISIS was behind the trip.Investigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel.As was the case with the Canadian, Couture, the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges, especially because the girls are minors, the two U.S. officials said.On Monday, Sheriff's Deputy Evan Driscoll visited the two girls of Somali descent in their home and had a conversation with them.'The girls explained that they stole the $2,000 and their passports from their mother,' he wrote in the runaway report.They wouldn't tell Driscoll why they flew to Germany.The deputy called dispatchers and had the girls' runaway listing removed.CNN's Pamela Brown, Evan Perez, Holly Yan and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-22T20:18:29Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140822024648-isis-fighters-2-story-top.jpg", "id": 2775}, {"title": "23  October  2014  Anderson Cooper 360", "url": "http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2014/10/23/", "text": "Anderson Cooper looks at the security camera video that captured the Ottawa shooting suspect driving away from the War Memorial.

Kurdish forces in Syria have said the fight is far from finished, and that Iraqi Kurdish forces will soon be joining them.Kurdish forces and ISIS militants have been clashing in the key border city for more than a month. On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 800 people have been killed there since the fighting started.The video posted online Monday is the latest ISIS has released of Cantlie, who's been held hostage for nearly two years.The British photojournalist, who also wrote several articles for major British newspapers, was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. In the first video of him released by the group last month, Cantlie made clear that he was forced to share a message from ISIS.The video released Monday portrays Cantlie as a reporter in the field describing Kobani. The hostage, dressed in black, appears close enough to the border to see Turkish flags in the background.'It seemed almost like a standup that a CNN correspondent would do in a foreign city,' Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst, said. 'It was designed to show that he's relaxed, that what he's saying is accurate. But clearly he's under duress.'Philip Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official, described the video as 'purely a propaganda play.' Even though it purports to show the strength of ISIS, Mudd said the video actually reveals weakness.'They're watching the same media we watch and seeing that their push for Kobani is not going very well. This is a message to respond to what they view as Western media portraying them as losing in Kobani,' he said. 'They think they need to respond.'The video also includes images of the heavily damaged city, filmed by what a caption says is an ISIS drone.Based on references Cantlie makes in the video, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh says it appears to have been filmed about a week ago.In the video, Cantlie describes weapons from a U.S. airdrop that he says made their way into the hands of ISIS -- a claim the group also made last week. The airdrops were sent to help Kurdish forces fighting to defend the city.A U.S. official said last week that one of 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani drifted away from its target zone.

On Monday another soldier was killed in a hit-and-run attack by a Muslim convert.The country earlier this month announced plans to join the US-led campaign of air strikes against Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq.There is no confirmation any of this week's attacks are linked to IS or the new military campaign.But Mr Harper, speaking late on Wednesday, said the attack would strengthen Canada's resolve in the fight against extremism alongside its allies.'They will have no safe haven,' he said.Mr Harper was addressing MPs at the time of the shooting but was safely evacuated.Citing unnamed Canadian officials, US and Canadian news agencies identified the dead gunman as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.On Wednesday morning, two soldiers guarding the memorial came under fire from a man carrying a rifle.One soldier, Cpl Nathan Cirillo, died of his injuries. Three other people were treated in hospital and released by evening.Minutes later, dozens of shots were fired inside the parliament building, Canadian MP Marc Garneau told the BBC.Canadian parliamentary waiter Alain Merizier described seeing a dark car stop outside parliament's centre block and a driver with 'a long gun' get out and run inside the entrance of the building, pursued by a parliamentary officer.He said: 'I was astonished more than frightened. You don't have time to be afraid.'MP John McKay described the moment the gunman attacked parliament: 'There was a pop, pop, pop sound so the guards ushered us to the back of the building.'How the gunman was able to walk down the hall of honour inside parliament with a rifle will become an area of investigation.'The gunman was shot dead in a heavy exchange of fire with police. It has not been confirmed that he was the one who shot the soldier at the memorial.In his evening address, Mr Harper gave no details about the gunman's background, identity or motive but said: 'In the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had.'Multiple members of parliament credited Sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers, 58, with shooting the assailant dead.'MPs and [Parliament] Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' New Democrat MP Craig Scott tweeted.Police told those in the vicinity of central Ottawa to stay away from windows and roofs as they searched for additional suspects.The nearby University of Ottawa was placed on lockdown, as well as all local police buildings and the US embassy.Marc Coucy of the Ottawa Police told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that officers were looking for 'multiple suspects' in shootings at three locations. But police later would not confirm if there was more than one gunman.About 20:25 local time (00:25 GMT), Ottawa police lifted the lockdown in Ottawa's city centre but said the investigation continued on Parliament Hill, which was closed to the public.Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson labelled the events a 'sad and tragic day for the city and country'.Earlier on Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters US officials had been in 'close touch' with their Canadian counterparts.In a telephone call with Mr Harper, US President Barack Obama condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the two nations' close friendship.The elevated terror threat level came in response to an increase in online 'general chatter' from radical groups including Islamic State and al-Qaeda, officials said.Are you in the area?

The Amazons mineral wealth and vast reserves of fresh water place the region in the context of potential threats, military officials here said in a statement.The operation will provide ways for optimizing a strategy of resistance in the region, said Gen. Guilherme Cals Theophilo Gaspar de Oliveira, chief of Brazils Amazon Military Command. He also emphasized that the exercise was aiming to consolidate a doctrine of jungle combat.The drill aims to prepare soldiers to respond to a foreign military force larger than Brazils armed forces, officials said. While Brazil has long been at peace with its smaller neighbors in the Amazon and no country was specified by name in the preparations for the exercise, some military strategists in Brazil have long focused on the United States as a potential threat.Officials in Brazil and the United States have rejected the possibility of any military clash between the two countries, the most populous in the Americas, over the Amazon, and ties between Braslia and Washington remain cordial though somewhat strained after revelations in 2013 that the National Security Agency had spied on President Dilma Rousseff and her inner circle.In fact, a chance for improving relations may be emerging after Ms. Rousseffs office noted positively that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had called her this month to congratulate her on her re-election and renew an invitation for her to visit Washington. Ms. Rousseff postponed a state visit in 2013 after the reports of N.S.A. spying.Still, the armys drill reflects thinking in Brazil that foreign powers covet the Amazon, about 60 percent of which is in the country. Fifty percent of Brazilians believe that their country will be invaded in an effort to grab the Amazons resources, according to 2011 opinion survey by a government statistics agency. The poll, which interviewed 3,796 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.Brazil expanded its military presence in the Amazon during the dictatorship that held power from 1964 to 1985, when generals offered incentives to settlers to occupy the frontier. While some political analysts contend that potential invasions belong in the realm of conspiracy theories, others delve into history to show that foreign designs on the Amazon are not so far-fetched.History books like The Deepest South, which describes an antebellum plan by southerners in the United States to develop the Amazon with American slaves, have been translated into Portuguese and discussed in the Brazilian news media.Brazils army also drew inspiration from history in naming its latest military exercise, which involves 550 troops here in Manaus, the Amazons largest city, and outposts like Santa Isabela do Rio Negro and Caracara. Machifaro is a region of the Amazon where in the 16th century resistance coalesced against Spains attempts to gain control of large portions of the rain forest held then by the Portuguese empire.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:20:07Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5601}, {"title": "Obama: More Nations Need to 'Step Up' in Ebola Fight", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/obama-more-nations-need-step-ebola-fight-n225781", "text": "President Obama says more nations need to join the fight against Ebola while speaking at Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday.", "source": "http://www.nbcnews.com/", "date": "2014-10-15T02:19:04Z", "top_image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/f_dc_obamajba_141014.jpg", "id": 298}, {"title": "Why West must roll back militarily in Iraq, Syria", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/05/opinion/isis-al-qaeda-quilliam/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Charlie Winter is a researcher on the Middle East at Quilliam, a think tank formed to combat extremism. The opinions in this commentary are solely his.(CNN) -- Last month, the Yemen-based branch of Ayman al-Zawahiri's international terrorist network, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), released a worrying statement calling on Muslims around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against American targets, be they civilian, governmental, military or diplomatic.But this was by no means the most troubling aspect of the communique.More important than the threat -- which, let's face it, is nothing new -- was the fact that this was the second statement from AQAP in recent months to go against al-Zawahiri's official policy towards ISIS and express its wholehearted support for the group's actions in Syria.The mere fact that AQAP has released another call for unity among Syria's jihadist factions is worth ruminating on for a number of reasons.It is indicative of the fact that the al Qaeda network is even more decentralized -- fragmented, even -- than first meets the eye. After all, AQAP was expressing its support for a group that had not only long rejected the authority of al-Zawahiri, its nominal leader, but is also engaged in the most bitter of hostilities with another al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra (JN). Making overtures to a group responsible for the death of thousands fighting for your closest ally in Syria is as significant as it is surprising.In releasing this statement, being outspokenly supportive of ISIS for the second time in just over a month, AQAP was sticking its neck on the line. However, its hubris paid off and the fact that we have, once again, heard nothing from al-Zawahiri compounds suspicions of his feeling blindsided and disempowered by the rise of ISIS.This latest message indicates just how much the global jihadist dynamic has shifted since the anti-ISIS coalition airstrikes began in August. Clearly, ISIS and al Qaeda are no longer as irreconcilable as many might have imagined back when the self-declared 'caliphate' was inaugurated in June.This phenomenon, something dealt with at length in Quilliam's latest report on ISIS, does not bode well.Indeed, were ISIS and al Qaeda to cooperate in the pursuit of their often identical goal, the threat would be profoundly more difficult to resolve. Certainly, there is a long way to go before this could happen, but that does not mean its slowly increasing likelihood should be ignored.And it is not only al Qaeda affiliates that have made overtures to Syria's warring jihadists.In September, for example, jihadist powerhouse Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi spearheaded a 'global initiative' to stop infighting in Syria and focus on the 'real' enemy, in light of the 'Crusader campaign'. This was a significant about turn for a man who had, in the past, referred to 'IS' in the most pejorative of terms.Statements of support are very different to pledges of allegiance but, whatever the case, a trend towards reconciliation does seem to be emerging. Among jihadists, ISIS is no longer the pariah it once was and, whether we like it or not, this is a direct result of coalition planes dropping coalition bombs on jihadists in Syria.This is unsurprising. As many predicted back in June, intervention against ISIS has been effortlessly worked into the 'War on Islam' paradigm, that great legitimizer of Islamist-motivated violence.In a reimagining of 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend,' we are seeing jihadists rallying around the flag of anti-Westernism. This trend may be slow, but the fact that it is happening at all is deeply alarming.Moving forward, it is imperative that the West -- the United States in particular -- rolls back its military involvement in Iraq and Syria and ups the ante in terms of its humanitarian and diplomatic efforts; the coalition must stop playing into the 'Crusader' paradigm.This means that -- and I've said this before -- regional, Sunni-majority countries must take the crisis into their own hands, force an end to the Assad regime's crimes and bring profound change to Iraq's political status quo. Without that, jihadists across the world will continue on the path toward rapprochement, something that must be stopped immediately.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:25:00Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141017121747-kobani-smoke-story-top.jpg", "id": 5681}, {"title": "Turkish Airstrike Hits Kurds, Complicating Fight Against Islamic State", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/world/europe/turkey-airstrike-kurds-isis.html", "text": "ISTANBUL  In the face of increasing international pressure, Turkey took decisive military action on Monday  not against the Islamic State militants that Turkeys Western allies have urged it to fight, but rather against the Kurdish militant group that has been battling the Islamic State.Turkish warplanes struck positions of the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the P.K.K., in southeastern Turkey late Monday. The group, long an enemy of the Turkish state, had put down its weapons last year to talk peace. But on Tuesday, Turkish officials said the Kurdish militants had attacked a military outpost, leading to the governments first airstrikes against the group in nearly two years.The action immediately reverberated well beyond Turkeys borders, because it is an offshoot of the P.K.K. that is struggling to defend the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, which has been besieged by Islamic State for weeks.As that battle has played out under the watch of news organizations, their cameras just across the border in Turkey, it has become a flash point for international criticism of Turkeys unwillingness to take a bigger role in fighting Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.But Turkeys actions against the Kurds and its refusal to allow the P.K.K. to shuttle reinforcements through Turkish territory to fight ISIS have led many analysts to this conclusion: that Turkeys leaders see the battle for Kobani mostly as a chance to let two of its enemies duke it out, rather than as a cause for alarm.Its a consistent approach to the conflict, said Aaron Stein, a Turkey expert and a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research organization. And I think they are happy to have them kill each other.Turkeys posture is one piece of what has become a tangled web of alliances and conflicting goals among the many countries who want to see Islamic State eradicated. The United States, for instance, has found itself sharing the battlefield in Iraq with Iranian-backed Shiite militias that once killed American soldiers. In Syria, the United States and Iran diverge, as Iran is a stalwart ally of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, while the United States would prefer to see Mr. Assad leave power.That dynamic of twisted allegiances has been on display in the fight for Kobani, too. While Turkey took military action against the P.K.K., the United States ramped up its bombing runs over Kobani in support of the P.K.K.s Syrian splinter group, the Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D.  even though the United States and its European allies have listed the P.K.K. as a terrorist group.The Pentagon saidon Tuesdaythat American and Saudi warplanes had carried out 21 airstrikes against Islamic State targets near Kobani on MondayandTuesday, the largest set of attacks in Syria since the air campaign began more than three weeks ago.For his part, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has insisted that ISIS and the P.K.K. pose the same threat and must both be confronted.Hey, world, when a terrorist organization like ISIS emerges, you all speak out, but why dont you speak out against the P.K.K. as a terrorist organization? Mr. Erdogan said recently. Why dont you call for a joint fight against them?Turkey does not only want to extinguish Kurdish ambitions of autonomy. It also wants the international coalition to fight not just ISIS, but Mr. Assads government as well.Turkey is against both ISIS and Assad, the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said Tuesday.It may be clear, then, who Turkeys enemies are, but it is far from clear what its strategy is to face them.Frankly, it doesnt seem like Turkey has a strategy, Mr. Stein said, adding that the decision to strike the P.K.K. at this moment was politically tone-deaf, even if there had been provocation.The peace process between Turkey and the P.K.K. brought a halt to a three-decade-long fight that cost more than 40,000 lives. But the strikes on Monday added to a sense that the dtente was now at risk, coming after a week in which violent street protests in response to the Turkish governments inaction on Kobani had left more than 30 people dead in Turkeys Kurdish region. Mr. Davutoglu on Tuesday sought to separate the situation in Kobani from Turkeys efforts to make peace with Kurds in Turkey.Im telling those who try to build a relationship between Kobani and the peace process  these two are different from each other, Mr. Davutoglu said. The peace process was there before Kobani, and saying so doesnt mean that we do not think of Kobani as important.Coming as it did while Turkey was under pressure from the United States to do more against ISIS, the military action against the P.K.K. represented, intentional or not, a pointed message to its Western ally.Airstrikes were not only a strong message to the P.K.K. but also to the United States, saying, I maintain my bargaining position in terms of what needs to be done in Syria, said Cengiz Candar, a columnist and expert on Turkeys conflict with the Kurds. It also legitimized not siding with the P.Y.D.But the message Kurdish leaders are taking is that Turkey is happy to see them die on the streets of Kobani.It is not two terrorist groups fighting against each other, said Idris Nassan, a spokesman for the fledgling Kurdish local government in Kobani. Terrorist groups are attacking civilians. The Turkish government must change its attitude.Both sides in the Kobani battle have suffered heavy losses. Kurdish activists say that their side is losing roughly 10 fighters a day, with the casualties obscured by the fact that most of the dead are not ferried across the border to Turkey. In a measure of the rising toll, six Kurdish fighters were buried in the Turkish town of Suruc on Tuesday, the highest number in at least a week.Kurdish fighters claim to have killed hundreds of Islamic State militants during intensifying clashes over the past week.That claim was impossible to verify. But witnesses in Raqqa, the Syrian province that serves as the Islamic State groups de facto capital, said that the bodies of dozens of ISIS fighters had arrived in the province from Kobani in the past few days.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-10-15T20:01:10Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 1047}, {"title": "Cluster bombs used in eastern Ukraine, says human rights group", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/cluster-bombs-ukraine-human-rights-watch", "text": "An explosion outside Donetsk.

Photograph: Oleksandr Klymenko/AFP/Getty ImagesEvidence collected by the New York-based Human Rights Watch suggests both government forces and pro-Russian separatists have used cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine.A spokesman for the Kiev governments military operation against the uprising in the east denied the accusations. The rebels were not available to comment.Cluster bombs explode in the air, scattering dozens of smaller bombs over an area the size of a sports field. Most countries have banned them under a convention that became international law in 2010, but Ukraine has not signed it.Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement it had carried out a week-long investigation in eastern Ukraine, where more than 3,700 people have been killed in fighting since April, and documented widespread use of cluster munitions.It said it could not conclusively determine responsibility for many of the attacks but the evidence points to Ukrainian government forces responsibility for several cluster munition attacks this month on Donetsk, the rebels main stronghold.It is shocking to see a weapon that most countries have banned used so extensively in eastern Ukraine, said Mark Hiznay, senior arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. Ukrainian authorities should make an immediate commitment not to use cluster munitions and join the treaty to ban them.In 12 incidents documented, cluster munitions killed at least six people and wounded dozens, but the toll could be higher, HRW said.It said it had identified the cluster munitions by their distinctive crater and fragmentation patterns, by remnants found at the impact sites and by remnants of the rockets found in the vicinity.Ukraines military spokesman, Andriy Lysenko, said: We do not use cluster munitions. They can only be used by aviation and our aviation has not flown since the announcement of a ceasefire on 5September.Another military spokesman, Vladyslav Seleznyov, described the accusations as utter nonsense.Human Rights Watch said: While not conclusive, circumstances indicate that anti-government forces might also have been responsible for the use of cluster munitions.Russia has denied sending troops or weapons to help the rebels but Human Rights Watch urged Moscow to commit itself to not using cluster bombs and agree to the cluster munitions treaty.", "source": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk", "date": "2014-10-22T01:28:58Z", "top_image": "http://static-secure.guim.co.uk/icons/social/og/gu-logo-fallback.png", "id": 2550}, {"title": "Iraqi forces, Peshmerga claim gains against ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/25/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi security forces have regained control of the area of Jurf al-Sakhar, a town south of Baghdad, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Saturday, as they battle to keep ISIS militants in check.In a post on Facebook, al-Abadi saluted the efforts made by Iraqi forces to liberate the area and said they 'have inflicted a strong blow to the terrorist organization ISIS.'Jurf al-Sakhar is on the outskirts of Hilla and is a mixed Sunni-Shiite area.The town was also the site of intense fighting in June between Iraqi forces and ISIS over the control of a military facility, where an infantry brigade is based, Iraqi security officials said.Farther north, Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces have liberated the northern Iraqi town of Zumar, west of the Mosul Dam, and its surroundings, according to the ruling party of the Kurdish Regional Government and Iraqi state TV.'Zumar is controlled by the Peshmerga forces. ISIS completely evacuated it,' Sheikh Ahmad Mohammad, a Peshmerga commander, told Kurdish news agency Rudaw.Specialized teams subsequently moved into the town to defuse all rigged homes and booby traps that ISIS left behind, Peshmerga operations commander in Mosul Sa'eed Mamzayn told CNN.Peshmerga forces also regained control of 10 villages around Zumar and killed 81 ISIS fighters, Heman Hawrami, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party Foreign Relations Office, said via Twitter.The U.S. military said 10 coalition airstrikes had been carried out against ISIS forces Friday and Saturday west of the Mosul Dam, destroying five ISIS units, a building used by the group and several fighting positions.Another coalition airstrike struck a large ISIS unit southeast of the Mosul Dam, according to the U.S. Central Command.Altogether, 22 airstrikes have targeted the Sunni extremist group in Iraq since Friday.ISIS took control of Zumar back in August when Peshmerga troops were forced to pull out after being surrounded by ISIS militants and being isolated from any support, Kurdistan Democratic Party regional official Ismat Rajab told CNN.News of the reported gains against ISIS in Iraq comes as Kurdish forces in Syria continue to battle ISIS for control of the Kurdish town of Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab.Clashes could be heard in the border town Saturday, but the Kurdish defenders appear to be holding their ground against ISIS as the militants seek to regain territory.There's been heavy fighting this week around Tal Shair, a strategic hill to the west of Kobani, as well as to the south and east of the city.Turkey has said it will allow Kurdish Peshmerga forces from Iraq to pass through its territory into Syria to join the fight for Kobani, which lies on the Syrian-Turkish border.Saleh Muslim, chair of the PYD, a Kurdish poitical party in northern Syria, told CNN that the Peshmerga and his party finalized their pact Friday night and fighters could enter Kobani Saturday evening or Sunday.The precise timing is unclear and dependent on part on Turkish permission, he said, adding that the armed wing of the PYD may also influence the timing in Kobani, the site of fierce fighting.As many as 150 fighters could be allowed in, but it's not yet clear exactly how many or when the reinforcements will arrive.One fighter in Kobani told CNN they could come as soon as Saturday night.There was one U.S. airstrike in Syria from Friday to Saturday, against an ISIS artillery piece near Kobani, U.S. Central Command said.CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Baghdad and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

It withstood attacks by the Roman Empire before falling in the third century A.D. to the Persian Sassanid Empire.Standing within inner and outer walls studded by scores of towers are large numbers of architectural treasures reflecting its long and diverse history.'There are palaces, temples and statues there, and ISIS is living among them,' Rashid said. 'I'm afraid they'll do something crazy there.'ISIS has also taken over Mosul Museum, turning it into an office to collect jizya -- a tax levied by the militant group on non-Muslims.The fate of the antiquities there is unknown.The U.N. cultural agency UNESCO has sounded the alarm over Hatra and other sites in Iraq, saying their preservation will play a role in any future peace.'Protecting the lives of people, their cultural heritage and identity go hand in hand,' the agency's director general, Irina Bokova, said at an emergency meeting in July.She pledged that UNESCO would mobilize the United Nations 'and the whole international community to safeguard Iraq's cultural heritage with particular emphasis on the fight against illicit trafficking in cultural property.'But while the conflict still rages, little can be done to protect artifacts on the ground.This isn't the first time that Iraq's precious cultural wealth has been under threat. The country's history is full of catastrophes.One of the worst was the Mongol sacking of Baghdad in 1258, when it's said the Tigris River ran red and black, with blood and the ink of thousands of priceless manuscripts.But to Rashid, the Mongols' barbarity pales in comparison with that of ISIS.'They are people from another planet,' he says. 'They take pride in nothing. Their mentality is completely petrified. They don't think of all this as the accomplishments of humanity.'CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Baghdad and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-22T20:18:33Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140902004227-pkg-coren-mosul-despair-00000730-story-body.jpg", "id": 2777}, {"title": "Don't Overreact, Canada", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/opinion/dont-overreact-canada.html", "text": "MONTREAL  Canada, so the reigning clich goes, is a peaceable country, the quaint counterpoint to the aggressive ways of its southern neighbor. And while part of that clich is hardly true  weve seen our fair share of wars  its central idea generally holds: Canadians tend to be less reactionary in the face of a perceived threat. Witness how Canada didnt participate in the Vietnam War, or the Iraq invasion in 2003. Cooler heads prevailed, perhaps because (to borrow another clich) they were watching a hockey game.Two recent attacks on Canadian soldiers threaten to lay waste to this cheery sensibility. On Oct. 20, a 25-year-old recent convert to Islam hit two soldiers with his car in a Quebec town about 25 miles outside Montreal, killing one before a police officer shot him. Less than 48 hours later, another Islamic convert shot and killed a soldier before dying in a shootout in Ottawa with the police and Kevin Vickers, Parliaments sergeant-at-arms.The two attacks sparked near-instantaneous calls for an increase in surveillance powers for Canadas law enforcement and intelligence agencies.In recent weeks, I have been saying that our laws and police powers need to be strengthened in the area of surveillance, detention and arrest, Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Parliament a day after the Ottawa attack. They need to be much strengthened. I assure members that work, which is already underway, will be expedited.Mr. Harper is right: The Canadian governments attempts to erode individual freedoms in the name of security started well before the deaths of the two soldiers. Last fall, the government shoehorned increased Internet surveillance powers into an anti-bullying bill, which would grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that voluntarily hand over customer data. The bill would also further lower the standards of evidence for police officers seeking to monitor Internet activities.More recently, the government introduced legislation that would give blanket anonymity to informants for Canadas spy agency. This would potentially allow for a dereliction of a basic principle of justice: An accused person would be unable to face his accusers.Yet the attacks have apparently loosened the tongues of those in government wanting the country to go even further. The government, Justice Minister Peter MacKay recently mused, should consider further powers to monitor and remove offensive websites, lest they lead to a poisoning of young minds. Jason Kenney, the minister for multiculturalism, recently suggested that those suspected of terrorist sympathies be subject to preventative detention  which the criminal code already permits  for longer time periods, and a lower legal threshold for the government to detain them.Its worth considering that such measures would not have prevented the recent attacks. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the perpetrator of the Ottawa shooting, had little online presence. His arrest record, a grab bag of drunken driving, drug possession, assault and weapons charges, suggests teenage overindulgence and inner demons, not a budding terrorist. Having drifted from his family, he lived on the margins of society for years. Hed recently told an acquaintance that the devil was following him around.In the case of Martin Couture-Rouleau, who hit the two soldiers with his car, law enforcement had already revoked his passport, and hed been under surveillance for months  including at the mosque he attended. He simply hadnt done anything to warrant arrest, preventive or otherwise. His online presence, meanwhile, was largely an Islamic-themed cacophony of anti-Semitism and cut-and-paste screeds against Christianity. While disturbing, only in the most totalitarian of states would this sort of thing constitute a crime.Besides, Canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have performed their jobs admirably without any increased powers. Canadian law enforcement has prevented at least two potentially disastrous terror strikes on Canadian soil in the last decade. And the countrys spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, isnt without resources: Its budget has more than doubled in the last 12 years.Canadians need only look to the south to see how attacks on individuals and establishments cant usually be prevented by increased surveillance of a countrys civilians. The United States arguably is home to the worlds largest and most sophisticated intelligence-gathering network, the excesses of which have been documented by leaks from the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.Yet none of this prevented the breach of the White House in September, in which an Iraq war veteran scaled the White House fence and made it to within feet of where the president and his family live before being apprehended. Nor has surveillance hindered the ability of various gunmen to inflict mass murder on innocents throughout the years. As the former Vice President Al Gore noted last year, in a speech decrying the folly of such mass intelligence gathering, When you are looking for a needle in a haystack, its not always wise to pile more hay on the haystack.Theoretically, it would be possible for the Canadian government to legislate itself the powers to prevent all such attacks. Yet the trade-off  constant surveillance, criminalization of dissent, restriction of free movement and the economy  would make the country unlivable. It would be a travesty if the actions of two troubled individuals moved the country closer to that possibility.Martin Patriquin is the Quebec bureau chief of Macleans magazine.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2014-11-08T06:09:48Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "id": 5550}, {"title": "Killing Khorasan bomb-maker a win -- but at what cost?", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/06/world/meast/syria-strike-bomb-maker/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- The United States appears to have just scored a big win in Syria in taking out a key al Qaeda bomb-maker plotting to blow up American passenger jets, but it could come at significant cost because the same strikes appear to have also killed fighters belonging to two powerful jihadist rebel groups who were fighting ISIS and not previously focused on targeting the United States.U.S. officials said the strikes overnight Wednesday in Idlib province to the west of Aleppo targeted Khorasan, a group of veteran al Qaeda operatives previously based in Afghanistan and Pakistan.A U.S. defense official told CNN's Barbara Starr one strike likely killed David Drugeon, a skilled French bomb-maker in the group, while he traveled in a vehicle.Drugeon, 24, was one of the most active bomb-makers within the Khorasan group, a U.S. intelligence official told Pamela Brown, and was working on non-metallic explosive devices which the group hoped to smuggle on board Western passenger aircraft.Among the devices Khorasan were developing to try to beat airport security: bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics and printer cartridges. Drugeon was also looking to recruit and train Western operatives for attacks in Europe, according to officials.The Pentagon said the strikes, in the vicinity of Sarmada, hit five Khorasan targets, including vehicles, buildings, and bomb-making and training areas.But reports from the ground suggest that facilities and vehicles belonging to Jabhat al Nusra and Ahrar al Sham were the ones hit overnight and that there were civilian casualties.According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes hit a Jabhat al Nusra vehicle in Samarda, the Jabhat al Nusra headquarters in the town of Harim -- just 14 miles from Sarmada, another Nusra building in al-Muhameen and a headquarters building belonging to Ahrar al Sham near the Bab-al Hawa border crossing with Turkey just a few miles from Samarda.This suggests U.S. intelligence believed Khorasan operatives were being hosted by elements belonging to the two jihadist groups. The strikes 'did not target the Nusrah Front as a whole,' the Pentagon stated Thursday, in an apparent concession that Nusra facilities were indeed in the firing line.On September 22, Nusra fighters were also apparently killed in cruise missiles strikes in Idlib province that the United States said were targeting Khorasan. Eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch said the strikes hit a Nusra compound near the village of Kafr Deryan, but also killed several civilians in the village.The deaths of Nusra and Ahrar al Sham fighters could create serious blow-back for the United States.Although Jabhat al Nusra is an al Qaeda affiliate and has ties to -- and some overlap of personnel with -- the Khorasan Group, its top leadership has not to date made attacking the United States and the West priority. The worry is that al Nusra could pivot away from its current focus on overthrowing the Assad regime toward plotting attacks in the West.While Khorasan has at most dozens of operatives, Nusra has thousands of fighters in its ranks, including hundreds of Western passport holders. It also operates training camps on a significant scale, controls a significant and growing swath of territory in Syria and has deep financial pockets.Nusra leader Muhammad al-Julani -- in a rare public declaration -- described the Western missile strikes as an assault on Islam, and warned the Western public: 'This is what will take the battle to the heart of your land, for the Muslims will not stand as spectators watching their sons bombed and killed in their lands, while you stay safe in your lands.'Ahrar al Sham, a powerful and well-funded Salafi-jihadist rebel group with widespread popularity among Syrian Sunnis, has to date kept its distance from al Qaeda and shown virtually no interest in its ambitions of global jihad.According to Charles Lister at the Brookings Doha Center, its leadership in recent months appeared to be gravitating toward more moderate positions. And Ahrar al Sham, like Jahbat al Nusra, has been involved in fierce fighting against ISIS over the last year.But Ahrar al Sham and Nusra leaders' anger over Wednesday night's strikes could see them soften their opposition to ISIS.In a Twitter message posted Thursday, Ahrar al Sham railed against the U.S.-led coalition for 'leveling to the ground' a headquarters building and called for an immediate halt to fighting between different rebel groups in Syria.U.S. intelligence is still assessing the impact of the strikes on Khorasan. Several of the group's leaders may still be alive. U.S. intelligence agencies were almost certain that the head of the group -- Muhsin al Fadhli, a 33-year-old Kuwaiti operative who was part of Osama bin Laden's inner circle before 9/11 -- survived the September 22 cruise missile strikes.Another senior operative in Khorasan is Abdul al Charekh, a 29-year-old Saudi former internet propagandist who ran al Qaeda's finances in the tribal areas of Pakistan before decamping for Syria at some point after 2012.And the group has at least one other operative with bomb-making knowledge: Abdelrahman al Johani, a Saudi operative in his mid-40s who U.S. intelligence believes has been plotting terrorist attacks against the West from Syria since becoming one of the founding members of the Khorasan Group in mid-2013.Al Johani, who remains on Saudi Arabia's most wanted list, was part of al Qaeda's leadership council and its counterintelligence chief in the tribal areas of Pakistan before moving to Syria around 2012. Saudi counterterrorism officials believe he previously received training in explosives and toxins.According to the United Nations, before joining Khorasan, al Charekh and al Johani had senior positions with Nusra in Latakia province, with the latter being in charge of foreign fighter networks, illustrating the overlap and ties between the two groups.U.S. officials believe al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has transferred bomb-making know-how to the Khorasan Group. Between 2009 and 2012, AQAP master-bombmaker Ibrahim al Asiri orchestrated three terrorist plots to bring down American aviation.In 2009, al Asiri fitted out a Nigerian AQAP recruit with an explosive underwear device containing PETN, a white, powdery, difficult-to-detect explosive, but the attempted attack failed to bring down a passenger jet landing in Detroit on Christmas Day.Al Asiri used the same explosive compound concealed in printer cartridges in a plot to blow up cargo jets headed to the United States just before the 2010 midterm elections. And according to Western counterterrorism officials, he used ETN, a closely related chemical compound, in a third plot targeting U.S. aviation with a more advanced form of the underwear device. The plot was thwarted by a Saudi-British spy in 2012 who was recruited for the suicide attack and retrieved the device.Experts tell CNN the latest generation of airport security scanners, including multi-view X-ray machines, and 'explosive trace detection' -- which involves running a hand-held device over the surface or inside of cabin and checked luggage, 'sniffing' the air for minute quantities of explosive -- have a good chance at detecting PETN and similar explosive compounds but offer no 100% guarantee, especially if the explosives are well-concealed and sealed.Western intelligence agencies believe al Qaeda groups such as AQAP and Khorasan are continuously trying to develop new ways to beat airport security. It is an arms race between al Qaeda bomb-makers and outfits developing explosive detection technologies that could not have higher stakes.CNN's Barbara Starr, Pamela Brown, Tim Lister and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:36:58Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141106163904-lead-dnt-starr-bomb-maker-killed-airstrikes-00000618-story-top.jpg", "id": 5961}, {"title": "Turkish jets bombard Kurdish positions", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/turkish-jets-bombard-kurdish-positions-pkk", "text": "Kurdish women react during a funeral ceremony for of YPG (People's Protection Units) fighters in the town of Suruc, Sanliurfa province, Turkey.Turkish fighter jets have bombarded Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) positions in south-eastern Turkey for the first time since the start of the peace process between the outlawed group and the Turkish government in 2012.The attacks on the PKK came in the wake of violent clashes last week between Kurdish factions and security forces in several Turkish cities, as anger grows over perceived government inaction against the Islamic State (Isis) attack on the Kurdish town of Kobani in Syria.According to media reports, Mondays strikes came in retaliation for armed PKK offensives on several military outposts in the area. The reports claim that the targeted PKK units had been attacking Dalca military posts using rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire for three days.The Turkish chief of general staff said the military opened fire immediately in retaliation, in the strongest terms after repeated PKK attacks in the area, and before air strikes were launched.The Turkish daily Hrriyetreported that the air strikes caused major damage to the PKK, while the Kurdish Firat news agency said there had not yet been any confirmation of casualties and losses on the rebel side.The Peoples Defence Force (HPG), the armed wing of the PKK, confirmed several air strikes in Hakkari province. After almost two years the occupying Turkish army conducted a military operation against our forces yesterday for the first time [] with these air strikes they violated the ceasefire, a statement read.Other Turkish newspapers also reported armed clashes between the PKK and troops in the Tunceli area of east-central Turkey on Monday.Meanwhile, Syrian Kurds in Kobani rejected claims by Iraqs Kurdistan regional government that military aid had secretly been delivered to forces battling Isis. We have not received any military aid from anyone so far, said Idris Nassan, deputy foreign minister of the Kobani administration. We would have made such aid public for sure.A number of those killed died in clashes between PKK supporters and members of the Free Cause party (Hda Par), thought to be linked to Hezbollah, a Sunni militant group from Turkey that gained notoriety in the 1990s when it was recruited by the Turkish deep state to murder and torture hundreds of PKK members and supporters in the region. Hda Par leaders rejected all responsibility for the violence last week and accused PKK members of deliberate provocation and political exploitation of the situation in Kobani.Observers fear that tensions between the PKK and their Sunni Islamist rivals might stir wider unrest and derail the Turkish peace process.

Although the main parliamentary building was full of MPs for weekly caucus meetings, no one was injured. The prime minister and opposition leaders were all reported safe. But a soldier standing guard at the nearby Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where the first shooting took place, died of his injuries.The centre of Ottawa surrounding the parliamentary precinct, which also encompasses the American embassy and British high commission, was locked down for more than four hours as police pursued what they believed were multiple suspects. Police briefing reporters at midday would not be drawn on whether they were still seeking other suspects.Terrorism is not unknown in Canada, but an attack on parliament still has the power to shock. Its impact has been compounded by an attack earlier this week on two Canadian soldiers at a military college near Montreal. The suspect behind this earlier attack is a Canadian who police say had converted to Islam and become radicalised.One of the soldiers later died. The gunman involved in Wednesdays shooting has not yet been identified and his motivation is unclear.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which provides security on Parliament Hill, faces tough questions about how an armed man could walk across a broad expanse of lawn and enter the main parliamentary building unhindered. Although the public is allowed in the area, access has been tightened in recent years and earlier this month Canadas security service raised the national threat level to medium from low.In the immediate aftermath, no party tried to use the shooting to political advantage. That will inevitably change. The Conservative government led by Stephen Harper has made fighting terrorism one of its signature themes. Mr Harpers decision to send Canadian fighter jets to Iraq is opposed by the two main opposition parties, the New Democrats and the Liberals.

The first was to work out how to integrate the effort of each into something that looks like a strategy. The second, underlined by the attendance of Barack Obama, was to demonstrate the seriousness of Americas commitment to defeating IS. The president implicitly acknowledged that both are a work in progress, saying that it was going to be a long-term campaign with periods of progress and setbacks.Right now, setbacks seem to be more evident than progress. Intensified air strikes by the Americans and Saudis have pushed back IS fighters besieging the Syrian-Kurdish border town of Kobane (Ain al-Arab in Arabic), but America says it may yet fall. Meanwhile, even with coalition air support, Iraqi security forces have put up only pitiful resistance to the latest IS surge in Sunni-dominated Anbar province. IS, which this week seized an army base near Hit, some 115 miles (185km) west of Baghdad, is now estimated to control more than three-quarters of the province. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of Americas joint chiefs of staff, says that, had it not been for the intervention of Apache attack helicopters last week, IS would have had a straight shot to Baghdad airport. General Dempsey has no doubt that IS will use indirect fire [mortar, rockets and artillery] into Baghdad in the days ahead.Mr Obamas hope for progress is hampered by the conflicting agendas of many of his coalition partners; and perhaps also by his own half-heartedness. The air campaign against IS has been so small by the standard of recent conflicts that it amounts to little more than military tokenism, says Anthony Cordesman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank. The difficulties of coalition management are starkly illustrated by the simmering row between Ankara and Washington. The refusal of Turkey to lift a finger to relieve the agonies of Kobane has cast a dark shadow over the whole enterprise (see article). American jets attempting to aid Kobanes desperate defenders are having to fly more than 1,200 miles from the Gulf because Turkey will not allow them to operate from Incirlik, a big NATO airbase less than 20 minutes away.Whether Turkey can be brought onside may depend upon Mr Obama conceding a long-standing demand of Mr Erdogans to establish a no-fly zone and buffer zone on the Syrian side of the Turkish border. Mr Erdogan also wants a commitment to take on the regime of Bashar Assad as well as IS. That is not on the cards, but to Mr Obamas discomfort, General Dempsey and the secretary of state, John Kerry, now both favour a no-fly zone.Measures being urged on the president include a big step-up in the tempo of air strikes in Iraq and Syria from the average of about seven a day since the campaign began to more than 150, and the use of special forces to provide forward air control.General Dempsey wants a much more intense training effort to reconstitute at least some of the Iraqi army into a moderately effective fighting force, requiring many hundreds, if not thousands, of Western soldiers. Even this may not be enough unless some of those advisers are embedded in Iraqi combat units to stiffen them in battle. None of this is palatable to Mr Obama. But as Mr Cordesman warns: The US is now embarked in leading and conducting a high-risk air campaign that will do too little and do it too slowly.", "source": "http://www.economist.com/", "date": "2014-10-20T00:04:09Z", "top_image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20141018_MAM957.png", "id": 1920}, {"title": "Missouri official calls for military coup against Obama", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/missouri-county-official-military-coup-barack-obama/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- A county official in Missouri is scaling back her latest suggestion that American troops should overthrow President Barack Obama.Jefferson County Recorder of Deeds Debbie Dunnegan called President Barack Obama 'our domestic enemy' and suggested the U.S. Constitution would give the U.S. military the authority to oust the president in a coup d'tat, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday.'I cannot and do not understand why no action is being taken against our domestic enemy.

One official with direct knowledge of the latest U.S. assessment said the working assumption now is that both Muhsin al-Fadhli, the leader of the group, and David Drugeon, a French jihadist and key member, who is believed to be a skilled bomb-maker, are alive. The United States does not know with certainty if they are injured.An intelligence analyst with knowledge of the intelligence tells CNN 'its 99.5% certain' they are alive.There had been scattered press reports about the fate of both men. But until now the United States had not indicated this strongly that it believes both men survived or left before a barrage of 47 U.S. Navy Tomahawk missiles on September 22 on several suspected Khorasan sites in Syria. Officials said news reports on Khorasan Group before the strikes may have had an impact on the effectiveness of striking the group.Drugeon is believed to be heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe. His name has not been widely disclosed by the United States. Like al-Fadhli and the rest of the Khorasan Group, U.S. officials say Drugeon has ties to the core al Qaeda group in Pakistan and is believed to have come to Syria from Pakistan in the last two years.U.S. officials said he is believed to be one of the key bomb-makers in the group and may have been actively involved with creating easily concealed bombs that led to increased security measures at overseas airports this past summer. U.S. intelligence officials said it's possible he may still be living in Syria. The United States is tracking a number of al Qaeda leaders believed to have moved into Syria, some having transited Iran to get there.Al Qaeda in Yemen's master bomb-maker, Ibrahim Al Asiri, is believed to have shared techniques and technology with Khorasan. One of the targets during the U.S. attack this fall was a bomb-making facility.Another U.S. official told CNN about a month ago there were communications intercepts suggesting the militants were discussing the possibility of Al Asiri traveling to Aleppo, Syria, to offer direct assistance to Khorasan and the Al Nusra Front, a related jihadist group.What's the difference between ISIS, al-Nusra and the Khorasan Group?U.S. officials believe Al Asiri did not take the risk of traveling to Syria and would not do so because of the presence of U.S. reconnaissance and surveillance over Syria and the stepped up airstrikes. It is not clear to what extent those intercepts were verified as representing Al Asiri's views.U.S. officials have said recently they believe the missile attacks against Khorasan did not destroy the group and that it still poses an imminent threat to the United States because of its ability to make bombs that are not readily detected by airport screening technology.The recently retired director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew Olsen, said the threat from the group is still significant.'This group was in a position to train without any sort of interference, they were able to recruit operatives. We saw that they were looking to test explosives. So they were in the advanced stages of plotting. And again they had both intent and that capability that put them nearing an execution phase of an attack,' Olsen told CNN's Jim Sciutto.'I don't think there's any realistic likelihood that some limited airstrikes even just for a period of time will degrade that threat altogether. Those individuals, they're hardened, seasoned veterans, and they've got an ability to operate pretty freely in Syria. So I think it's unlikely that threat's altogether been eliminated.'The United States has not acknowledged striking against the Khorasan Group since that first night in September.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T22:52:39Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141030172401-lead-dnt-brown-bombmaker-threat-00001608-story-top.jpg", "id": 4086}, {"title": "White House insists anti-Isis strategy is on track despite setbacks on the ground", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/white-house-anti-isis-strategy-on-track-despite-setbacks", "text": "The US-led campaign to combat Islamic State (Isis) fighters in Syria and Iraq is facing a growing crisis of confidence as setbacks on the battlefield coincide with efforts to improve allied coordination and calls for President Barack Obama to escalate the military attacks.White House officials insist their twin strategy of air strikes and support for local ground forces is still working despite advances by Isis outside Baghdad and in the Syrian town of Kobani, but concede they will consider calls for additional bombing if requested by the Pentagon.In the last two days alone, the US has conducted 21 separate air strikes on Isis forces in and around Kobani and recently deployed Apache attack helicopters to repel advances on Baghdad airport.Yet the latest damage assessment released by the Pentagon on Tuesday focused primarily on damage to Isis staging locations and buildings rather than claiming much success against fighters on the ground who are dispersed in urban areas and much harder to target using current tactics.I am confident the president would want to reserve that option dependent on the advice he gets from his military planners, the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters when asked whether Obama was willing to escalate the air campaign against Isis.Chiefs of defence from 20 US military partners are meeting at Andrews air force base outside Washington for a two-day meeting aimed at ensuring the military capabilities of our partners are integrated and effectuated.Obama was due to address the assembled international military brass in a session later on Tuesday amid reports from some air forces involved that they are running out of obvious Isis targets in Iraq and a reticence among others to become dragged into Syria.Following his meeting with the international defence chiefs Obama stressed that this is going to be a long-term campaign during brief remarks to reporters. There are going to be periods of progress and setbacks, he added, but insisted the coalition remained united in defeating Isis.The alliance is under its greatest strain in Turkey, which has met US requests to intervene in Kobani on behalf of Kurdish rebels not just with refusal, but with air strikes aimed instead against Kurdish groups in Turkey.Turkish fighter jets bombarded Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) positions in south-eastern Turkey this week for the first time since the start of the peace process between the outlawed group and the Turkish government in 2012.The attacks on the PKK came in the wake of violent clashes last week between Kurdish factions and security forces in several Turkish cities, as anger grows over perceived government inaction against the Isis attack on Kobani.According to local media reports, the strikes came in retaliation for armed PKK offensives on several military outposts in the area.The Turkish chief of general staff said the military opened fire immediately in retaliation, in the strongest terms after repeated PKK attacks in the area, and before air strikes were launched.White House officials were also forced to clarify on Tuesday that talks are ongoing between the US and Turkey over the right to use airbases against Isis and for training purposes.The national security adviser, Susan Rice, claimed over the weekend that such permission had been obtained but this was later denied by the Turks.Obamas approach in Syria and Iraq is under growing criticism in Washington, not just from traditional hawks like John McCain who are calling for US ground troops to be deployed, but also in the media where columnists are increasingly arguing his strategy against Isis has failed.", "source": "http://www.theguardian.com/us", "date": "2014-10-15T02:25:25Z", "top_image": "http://static-secure.guim.co.uk/icons/social/og/gu-logo-fallback.png", "id": 489}, {"title": "CNN journalist: 'We wanted to believe' Nigerian girls would be freed", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/06/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-sesay/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- For weeks, Nigerian officials said that more than 200 Nigerian school girls would finally be freed. When it fell apart, there was nothing but devastation.Over and over, sources told CNN's Isha Sesay that negotiations between the government and Boko Haram, the group that snatched the girls in April, were getting somewhere. The journalist was assured that the Islamist terror group had agreed to a cease-fire, and as part of that deal, the girls would be able to return to their families.For once, Sesay allowed herself to feel optimistic.A native of Sierra Leone, the journalist was personally drawn to the tragedy that inspired the global campaign 'Bring Back Our Girls.''Those girls were poor, from a remote part of Nigeria,' in Chibok in Borno State, Sesay said.The area has been long ignored, and the people there have gotten by on very little, she said.The girls were kidnapped while they were at school.'They were just trying to get an education,' Sesay said. 'But for the grace of God, I come from an educated family and my life has been different. It's the power of education that has allowed me to become a CNN anchor. These girls were in school to change their circumstances.'Sesay got on a plane to Nigeria days ago as sources told her that the girls' freedom was imminent.When she landed she started to hear more from journalists who have extensively covered Boko Haram, and from those who knew how the terror group operated.They were suspicious, and doubted that the government was really in talks with the terrorists.There were other red flags. No one from Boko said anything about the supposed cease-fire. In fact, members remained active in northeastern Nigeria, and actually carried out more attacks and child abductions.Sesay and her CNN crew kept hoping. Maybe it was simple banditry in the north, she reasoned. It was hard to bear the idea that the girls wouldn't be freed.'We wanted to believe,' she said. 'We gave (Nigerian officials) the benefit of the doubt, I suppose.'On November 1, a video appeared of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau saying no cease-fire been reached. The girls were not going to be released, he said, laughing.They had converted to Islam and were married off.'They are,' he said, 'in the marital homes.''It was like he was saying, 'This is done,' ' Sesay recalled.After the video was released, Nigeria's government asserted that negotiations had happened, and Shekau had gone back on promises he'd made during those talks.'We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,' a spokesman said. 'Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight.'In late October, Human Rights Watch released a report on Boko Haram violence against women and girls in Nigeria. The group interviewed kidnap victims including a dozen of the Chibok girls who escaped. The girls had been imprisoned in eight Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest Reserve, the report said.The women and girls who refused to convert to Islam were physically and sexually assaulted, HRW said, and some were forced to marry their captors.Men and boys who were abducted, the report says, were given the choice of joining the group or being murdered.What gives Boko Haram its strength?'How could they do this?'Before she left Nigeria, Sesay called Obiageli Ezekwesili, a former Nigerian government official and one of the leaders of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign.'She sounded sick with grief when she answered the phone,' Sesay recalled. 'I said ... 'Are you OK?' which is ... so stupid. She was just -- her voice was hoarse with pain. She said, 'How could they do this?' 'Ezekwesili said she wasn't sure if the parents of the girls would recover.Sesay said she is committed to continue to tell the girls' stories. Each is a person. Each deserves to live out their unique passions and paths.'We have to keep asking questions,' she said. 'We have set expectations low in terms of getting meaningful answers. That can't continue.'", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:44:04Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141106053534-pkg-sesay-nigeria-what-happened-00024207-story-top.jpg", "id": 6067}, {"title": "Ottawa shooting: CCTV shows suspect arriving at parliament", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-29749775", "text": "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have released video footage of the suspected gunman arriving at the country's parliament building during Wednesday's shooting incident.He has been as named 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau by police.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:52:53Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3180}, {"title": "Theo Padnos, American Journalist, on Being Kidnapped, Tortured and Released in Syria", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/magazine/theo-padnos-american-journalist-on-being-kidnapped-tortured-and-released-in-syria.html", "text": "In the early morning hours of July 3, one of the two top commanders of Al Qaeda in Syria summoned me from my jail cell. For nearly two years, he had kept me locked in a series of prisons. That night, I was driven from a converted schoolroom outside the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, where I was being held, to an intersection of desert paths five minutes away. When I arrived, the commander got out of his Land Cruiser. Standing in the darkness amid a circle of men draped in Kalashnikovs, he smiled. Do you know who I am? he asked.Certainly, I said. I knew him because he visited me in my cell once, about eight months earlier, and lectured me about the Wests crimes against Islam. Mostly, however, I knew him by reputation. As a high commander of the Nusra Front, the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, he controlled the groups cash and determined which buildings were blown up and which checkpoints attacked. He also decided which prisoners were executed and which were released.He wanted to make sure I knew his name. I did, and I repeated it for him: Abu Mariya al-Qahtani. You are our Man of Learning, I added, using the term  sheikhna  that his soldiers used to refer to him.Good, he said. You know that ISIS has us surrounded?I did not know this.He shrugged his shoulders. Not to worry. They wont get me. They wont get you. Everywhere I go, you go. Understand? I nodded.We drove to a residential compound next to an oil field near the Euphrates. For the rest of the night, I watched as some 200 foot soldiers and 25 or so religious authorities and hangers-on from the Afghan jihad prepared for their journey.There were bags of Syrian pounds to stuff into the cabs of Toyota Hiluxes, boxes of stolen M.R.E.s to load onto the truck beds and suitcases and water coolers to fit in beside them. And there was the weaponry: mortars, rockets, machine guns, feed bags filled with grenades and bullets, stacks of suicide belts.By 4 in the morning, the packing was done. At dawn, the commander drove to the head of the column of Hiluxes and fired his handgun into the air. Within seconds we were gone, flying over the sand. There are roads in this part of Syria. We didnt use them.I was now 20 months into my life as a prisoner of the Nusra Front: the abrupt departures, the suicide belts, the mercurial behavior of the Man of Learning, the desert convoys, the way I might be shot or spared at any moment  this was my world. I was almost used to it.In October 2012, however, when I was first kidnapped, I used to sit in my cell  a former consulting room in the Childrens Hospital in Aleppo  in a state of unremitting terror. In those first days, my captors laughed as they beat me. Sometimes they pushed me to the floor, seized hold of a pant leg or the scruff of my jacket and dragged me down the hospital corridor. If someone seemed to take an interest in the scene, I would scream: Saadni! (Help me!) The onlookers would smirk. Sometimes they called out a mocking reply in English: Ooo, helb me! Ooo, my God, helb me!Because there was no bathroom in my cell, I had to knock on the heavy wooden door when I needed the toilet. Often, the guards wouldnt come for hours. When they did, they would bang on the door themselves. Shut up, you animal! they would say.The cruelty of my captors frightened me, but my bitterest moments in those early weeks came when I thought about who was most responsible for my kidnapping: me.I believed I knew my way around the Arab world. In 2004, when the United States was mired in the war in Iraq, I decided to embark on a private experiment. I moved from Vermont to Sana, the Yemeni capital, to study Arabic and Islam. I was good with languages  I had a Ph.D. in comparative literature  and I was eager to understand a world where the West often seemed to lose its way. I began my studies in a neighborhood mosque, then enrolled in a religious school popular among those who dream of a back to the days of the prophet version of Islam. Later, I moved to Syria to study at a religious academy in Damascus. I began to write a book about my time in Yemen  about the mosques and the reading circles that formed after prayer and the dangerous religious feeling that sometimes grew around them.At the beginning of the Syrian civil war, I wrote a few articles from Damascus, then returned to Vermont in the summer of 2012. Just as the Islamists were beginning to assert their authority in Syria, I began pitching articles to editors in London and New York about the religious issues underlying the conflict. By now, I could recite many important Quranic verses from memory, and I was fluent enough in Arabic to pass for a native. But these qualifications mattered little. The editors didnt know me; few bothered to reply. Perhaps, I thought, if I wrote from Syria itself, or from a Turkish town on the border, Id have better luck. On Oct. 2, 2012, I arrived in Antakya, Turkey, where I rented a modest room that I shared with a young Tunisian. I tried pitching the editors again. Still nothing. I began to despair of publishing anything and cast about for something else to do. Should I try teaching French? I wondered. Coaching tennis?I spent my afternoons in Antakya walking up a mountain on the outskirts of the city and looking across into Syria. By this time, despite its aggressive bombing campaign against the opposition and the civilian population, President Bashar al-Assads military government was losing ground. The international community condemned Assad for his actions against civilians, but none that joined in the censure, including the United States, intervened militarily. On TV, Islamic preachers railed against the Syrian government: Those who helped it would have their flesh cut into bits, then fed to the dogs. The government, for its part, warned that in areas of the country under opposition control, fanatical Islamists, possibly in the pay of the Israelis, were sneaking in from Iraq and Libya. The main opposition group, the Free Syrian Army, founded by former Assad generals and considered moderate by many in the West, had taken over the two most important border crossings north of Aleppo.One day as I walked up the hill outside Antakya, an idea for an essay came to me. Anyone who has lived in Syria knows how bitter the divides are between the pious and the secular, the Assad loyalists and the dissidents, the well connected and those who struggle to get by. It would be impossible to plot these divisions on a map, because they often run through families, even individuals. Nevertheless, by the autumn of 2012, a traveler might have oriented himself by them: Most who lived east of the mountain chain that runs from the city of Homs toward the Turkish border were Sunni opponents of the government; most who lived in the mountains or to the west were Alawite supporters of Assad.As I walked, I envisioned myself traveling along these fault lines. I would stop into villages and interview people, telling the story of a nation with many identities, dissatisfied with them all, in trouble, wanting help. In the background would be a narrator in a similar situation.My experience in Arab countries ought to have given me pause. After I published my Yemen book, I changed my name from Theo Padnos to Peter Theo Curtis, worried that the book might make reporting from the Middle East difficult. I knew how Westerners were often viewed. But I had done all my studying under the eye of military governments, in places where the secret police listened to every word uttered in every mosque. I had never set foot in a region where only a militant Islam held sway. Things are different in such places. Almost immediately, I fell into a trap.One afternoon in Antakya, I met three young Syrians. They seemed a bit shifty, but not, as far as I could tell, more militantly Islamic than anyone else. Our job is to bring stuff from here to the Free Syrian Army, they told me. They offered to take me with them. Thinking Id be back in a few days, I told no one, not even my Tunisian roommate, where I was going.We slipped through a barbed-wire fence in the middle of an olive grove. I looked back toward Turkey. So far, so good. My Syrian friends led me to an abandoned house that I could use as a kind of field office. The next morning, I helped the young men straighten up the place, cleaning the floors and arranging pillows in an orderly row on a rubber mattress. They sat me down in front of a video camera and asked me to interview one of them, Abu Osama. When we were done, the cameraman smiled, walked across the room and kicked me in the face. His friends held me down. Abu Osama stomped on my chest, then called out for handcuffs. Someone else bound my feet. The cameraman aimed a pistol at my head.Were from Al Tanzeem Al Qaeda, Abu Osama said, grinning. You didnt know? He told me I would be killed within the week if my family didnt provide the cash equivalent of a quarter kilogram of gold  which the kidnappers thought was about $400,000 but was actually closer to $10,000  the sum to which he was entitled, he said, by the laws of Islam.Despite the video and the ransom demands, these kidnappers were amateurs. That night, I slipped out of the handcuffs that attached me to one of the sleeping men. In the soft sunlight of the Syrian dawn, I sprinted past walls covered in graffiti, through a cemetery and over a median strip, then stopped a passing minibus. Take me to the Free Syrian Army right away, I said. This is an emergency.When I arrived at the F.S.A. headquarters, I appealed to the officers in the most desperate terms. They argued a bit among themselves, then took me to an Islamic court, where a judge questioned me and remanded me to a cell that had been converted from a Turkish toilet. There were prisoners in the cells on either side of me. I poked my head through a food hatch. A 10-year-old boy did the same. What did you do? I said. He withdrew, and a middle-aged man, his father, I presumed, poked his head out. What did you do? I repeated.A helpless grin appeared on his face. Were Shia, he said.Ten minutes later, the F.S.A. officers returned, accompanied by my kidnappers, and I was trundled into a car and taken to an F.S.A. safe house. There I was placed in a hole in the ground. Was I six feet below the surface? Only three? I didnt know. Officers threw dirt on me, laughing and shouting insults. Someone jumped down and landed on my chest. Someone else beat me with the butt of his Kalashnikov. One officer insisted that I reply to his questions by yelling out, I am filth, sir!A few days later, the F.S.A. transferred me to a group of Islamists, and I had my first lesson in how to distinguish Islamist fighters from the Free Syrian Army: The fundamentalists think of themselves as the vanguard of an emergent Islamic state. They torture you more slowly, with purpose-specific instruments. You never address them as sir, because this reminds everyone of the states secular military. When the Islamists torture you, they prefer to be addressed by a title that implies religious learning. For the younger fighters, ya sheikhi! (o, my sheikh!); for the older ones, emir.The F.S.A., it turned out, had given me to the Nusra Front, or Jebhat al Nusra, which was using the Childrens Hospital in Aleppo as a headquarters and a prison. During my first days there, I couldnt believe that what was happening to me was actually happening to me. My mind kept replaying the hours just before and after the young men I met in Turkey attacked me. It seemed to me that I had been walking calmly through an olive grove with Syrian friends, that a rent in the earth had opened, that I had fallen into the darkness and woken in a netherworld, the kind found in myths or nightmares. I knew there was a kind of logic to this place, and I could tell that my captors wanted me to learn it. But what exactly they wished to teach me, and why they couldnt say it straight out but preferred to speak through their special language of pain, I couldnt understand. When the emirs came to my cell, they often stood in a semicircle over my mattress, muttered among themselves, dropped a candy wrapper or a used tissue on the floor, spit and then left without saying a word.One afternoon during the first week of my imprisonment, a group of younger fighters gathered in my cell. I was in handcuffs and lying with my face to the wall, as an interrogator had instructed. During the beating that followed, one fighter, apparently disturbed by the violence, asked, Have there been orders to do this to the prisoner? No one answered.The leader  Im not sure who it was, I couldnt see  carried a heavy stick and a cattle prod. As I lay there, he hit me across the back of the head, then strolled around the room reciting prayers. When I heard his footsteps, I raised my hands to protect my head. In a deadened voice, he would say, Bring your hands down. I would remove my hands. He would thwack me across the back of the head. Instinctively, my hands would return to my head. He would shock me with the cattle prod. The electricity jerked my body about. My hands would end up on my chest. He would hit me again.Im not sure how long this beating lasted  perhaps an hour, perhaps only 20 minutes. Toward the end, I heard the leader approach and braced myself for another blow. It didnt come. Instead, he knelt close to me and whispered in my ear: I hate Americans. All of them. I hate you all.After this, I lost track of time. I dreamed that the fighters were rolling my body in a winding sheet and lashing my ankles together with golden straw. In the days after this dream, I thought, I have seen the winding sheet, so I must be quite far along in the killing process. But every time I asked myself if I was alive or dead, the answer came back, You are most certainly alive. I thought, The custom must be to wrap the corpses in the winding sheets before they are entirely dead. How peculiar. I didnt know.For several days, I lingered in this state. A pile of sandbags blocked the sun from the rooms only window. The electric light worked intermittently  a few hours here, a few hours there, then darkness. There were many mornings on which I woke unsure if it was day or night. I knew there was a point to my treatment, but I struggled to see what it was. Eventually, the logic became plain: Al Qaeda plays with its prisoners sleep because it wants to have a controlling presence in every second of their lives, even in the unconscious seconds  perhaps especially in those.After a month or so, I realized that my captors did not mean to kill me, at least not right away. There was, however, no hint that the nightmare I was living in would end soon. When they spoke of my emerging from jail, it was as a crippled old man. When they brought me food  usually olives and a sweet sesame paste called halvah on a hospital tray  they threw it on the floor. Eat, you swine, they would say. Then they would slam the door. They slammed it with such force that after a month the door handle fell off.The chief of the Childrens Hospital jail was a Turkish-speaking Kurd. He sometimes allowed a group of Turkish jihadis to lounge in the hallway outside my cell. Their job, as far as I could tell, was to call the dawn prayer and harass prisoners as the guards escorted them to the bathroom. Every morning, as I was led in a blindfold and cuffs to the toilet, they spat at me and slapped me across the head and shoulders.One day, one of these Turks took a running start from the end of the corridor and landed a karate kick against my rib cage. Both of us ended up on the ground.I think they broke my rib, I complained to a guard. For no reason. I was blindfolded. This is not O.K.He reflected on this for a moment, then shrugged. Yes, it is, he said. Its fine.Something in this guards manner made me think I might be able to negotiate with him. He was in the habit of hitting me with a piece of PVC pipe every time he entered my cell. It stung, but it didnt really injure me. When you hear the sound of the key in the lock, you put your face to the wall, he would say. I did as he asked. He hit me anyway.One day, before he hit me, I made a point of expressing to him just how completely my face was pressed to the wall. Youre going to hit me anyway? I asked. What are you doing, sheikh? Why?I peeked at him. He grinned. I want to train your soul, he said.O.K., I thought. I must make him believe that my soul is receiving its training. After that, when he entered the cell, I would yell: Sheikh! My face is to the wall! Then I waited, peeked and inquired if he thought I was learning.A little bit, perhaps, he would reply.Soon he stopped hitting me. One evening, on delivering my tray of halvah and olives, he smiled at me. A few days later, after dinner, he brought me apples (it was late November in Aleppo) and tea. When he left, I thought, Apples, tea and no beating  progress.But this guard was on duty only once every four days. Some of the other guards insisted on the face-to-the-wall routine. Some did not. None brought me tea or apples.During much of the fall and winter of 2012, I felt I had fallen into the hands of a band of sadists. Youre C.I.A.  theyre going to barbecue your skin, the guards would whisper. Did this mean death by fire? During an interrogation session, the Kurd, who liked to be called Sheikh Kawa, nodded at a prisoner whose wrists were cuffed to a pipe just beneath the ceiling. His feet bicycled through the air. You must let me down, for the sake of God! For the sake of Muhammad and God! he screamed.This is our music! Kawa yelled at me. Do you hear it?That night, Kawa tortured me and told me that if I didnt confess to being a C.I.A. operative, he would kill me. I confessed to stop the pain. If a single letter of what youve told us tonight is untrue, Kawa said as he led me away, we will put a bullet in your head.Kawa tortured me again, but as December turned into January, I began to think that some higher Qaeda authority wanted me to live. If I lived, I could say good things  about the Nusra Front and Islam. I was then, and remain now, more than willing to say good things about Islam.When religious authorities or higher-ranking Nusra Front members  anyone with bodyguards  came by my cell, I sometimes recited verses from the Quran. These were verses that I loved, and the visitors seemed pleased. But the net result of these recitations was . . . nothing. Eventually, one of the more educated guards explained to me that as a Christian and an American, I was his enemy. Islam compelled him to hate me.Yes, he said. America had killed at least one million Muslims in Iraq. Anyway, the Quran forbade amicable relations: O you who believe! this guard would recite. Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. And whoso among you takes them for friends is indeed one of them.I kept track of time by marking off the passing days on a calendar Id scratched into the prison wall. It was January 2013 when the prison administration began offering me the opportunity to convert to Islam. Every day, the guards preached to me and recited the Quran. In Arabic, you dont convert to Islam, you submit to it. Ya, Bitar (O, Peter), the fighters would say, why havent you submitted yet? For a while, I thought that if I submitted, my life would improve, but I soon learned that even conversion would not help me.In the third week of January, they put another American in my cell. He was an aspiring photojournalist from New York named Matthew Schrier. (When he arrived, I realized my makeshift calendar was 10 days behind.) At first, Matt refused to learn a word of Arabic, hoping his ignorance would make the interrogators less likely to think him a spy. Then, in early March, the commanders placed a third person, a Moroccan jihadi they suspected of spying, in our cell. The Moroccan spoke passable English and was a ferocious proselytizer. He soon persuaded Matt to submit to Islam.Matt asked for an English-language Quran. A guard gave it to him. A few days later, Matt said the magic words  I testify that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is his prophet  in front of witnesses. When word got around that Matt had converted, the younger fighters would point at him and say, You, good! Then they would point at me and say, You, bad!But the conversion did not get Matt better food, and it certainly did not get him home. Once, one of the more volatile guards slapped him as we were being taken to the bathroom. You, bad! he said to Matt. You lie about religion. The guard nodded at me. You, you Christian, he said. You, good.I learned, eventually, to deflect the enthusiasm of the proselytizers. Allah has created me a Christian, I would say. Its not my fault. They offered their counterarguments: If you were to die as an unbeliever today, Allah would refuse to admit you into heaven. Once each side had its say, we moved on to other things  the war in Syria, or politics, or their favorite topic, Western girlfriends. These sessions soon followed a typical pattern: My guards spent the first 10 minutes trying to get me to accept Islam. Then they gave up. Then they asked if I could introduce them to single women from a Western country.During the spring and early summer of 2013, the Nusra Front moved Matt and me through a series of ad hoc prisons. We were held in a villa on the outskirts of Aleppo, in a shuttered grocery store, at a shipping warehouse and in the basement of a Department of Motor Vehicles branch. We had a rough idea of where we were, because the fighters who administered these jails sometimes arrested people from the neighborhood and put them in the cells with us.Toward the end of July 2013, Matt and I devised a way to crawl out of a small window in our cell. As we planned our escape, we agreed that Matt would go first and, once in the open air, would help me wriggle though. On the morning of July 29, the first part of the operation went off without a hitch. But the second part did not go as planned. Matt managed to escape and eventually made it home. I remained behind.After this, the Nusra Front was convinced that Matt and I were highly trained C.I.A. operatives. A highly trained C.I.A. operative in the hands of Al Qaeda is in deep trouble, the fighters explained. For much of the ordeal that followed, I was blindfolded; my feet and hands were bound for all of it. It lasted some 45 days. At the end of it, I found myself six hours by car from Aleppo, somewhere near the eastern city of Deir al-Zour.In this new prison, I dedicated myself to making friends with the fighters who guarded me. As summer turned to fall, they began to give me adequate food, joke with me and take me outside to sit, in handcuffs and a blindfold, in the desert sun.This was a homey prison. It consisted of four cells, each the size of a narrow toilet stall, each equipped with a padlocked, home-welded steel door with a food hatch. I couldnt see the other prisoners. The merest hint of conversation among us was punished with beatings. Nevertheless, when the guards were playing with their guns or busy watching cartoons, we sometimes whispered to one another. At times, I sang. The Nusra Front believes, as many Muslims do, that Allah made song unlawful for Muslims. Yet no one thinks this prohibition applies to Christians. So I sang, sometimes loud enough for the guards to hear. Often it was Desperado; theres a popular Arabic version. Even the guards, I think, liked that one.By May of this year, after 19 months in prison, I had almost come to terms with Qaeda reality. I got along adequately with the jail administration. I had enough food and water. It seemed to me that I might someday be released or I might someday be shot, but that I had no power to affect my fate. To keep my mind occupied, I decided to write a story, set in Vermont, on the pages of a calendar Id found in a house where I had been imprisoned. It was about love, home and religious enthusiasm.I didnt know it at the time, but the Nusra Front was losing its war with the Islamic State, the group often referred to as ISIS. From conversations with guards and other prisoners, I gleaned that the two organizations were about equal in strength and that under no circumstances would the Islamic State be allowed to touch the oil fields, the real prize in Syrias east. But in mid-June, when I was allowed to watch TV for the first time since my capture, I saw a map covered in Islamic State logos. Soon, the Nusra Front stopped construction on a prison it was building next to my cellblock. Why? I asked a guard.In early June, they took away all of the prisoners except me; I dont know what happened to them.June turned to July. Suddenly I found myself standing at the edge of the desert with the Man of Learning. He gave me a suit of jihadi clothing, told me to blend in with his fighters and promised me that once we got to Daraa, a city near the eastern edge of the Golan Heights, he would send me back to my family.We traveled in the same car. He talked to me about the difficulties of being a mujahid, or Fighter on the Straight Path of God. One afternoon early in our voyage, he told me that the world misunderstood him. It must be difficult when the whole world wants to kill you, I said. Plus all the problems now with ISIS. And Bashar al-Assad probably wants to kill you, too.Yes, he said. Its true. But ISIS are the worst. They have made me very sad.He sighed. His mood was resigned. Over the following days, he often tried to cheer his lieutenants by recounting a funny story or embolden them by heaping contempt on enemy commanders or imams. With me, he talked about my future as a reporter: I would become a specialist on Al Qaeda. I would be the first reporter to tell the world the truth about the jihad in Syria. Yes, of course, I said.After our first conversation, he made sure that I was either in the pickups cab with him or in the truck directly behind his. For the next 10 days, our caravan snaked its way through the dunes. We dodged the patrols of the Syrian Air Force, skirted the governments outlying military bases, sneaked past hostile Druze villages. And then one night, after traveling several hundred miles, our train of pickups and Kia Rios arrived at a ridgeline bunker about 20 miles east of Damascus. A detachment of Free Syrian Army soldiers held the position. They welcomed us, but with no special warmth.Within days, Syrias air force had detected our presence. It bombed the bunker. It killed a Nusra Front fighter, destroyed six vehicles and then  for reasons I have yet to understand  left us in peace.During this time, in the early mornings before my guards woke up, I walked on the ridgeline by myself. I would look for planes and think about what would happen if I tried to escape. One morning, I ran into four Free Syrian Army soldiers. How lucky, I thought. If I could get them to promise not to hurt me, if I could persuade them to place me beyond the range of the Nusra Front machine guns, I would be free.Yet how was I to communicate with the F.S.A.? At the outset of our journey, the Man of Learning told me that I was never to talk to outsiders. That morning, I decided to take a risk.The F.S.A. soldiers were heating up their tea. Hey! I said to them. Whats your news? Peace be upon you. They returned my salaams. One asked where I was from.Im sorry, I said. I cant talk to you. They gave me a cup of tea, and the five of us drank in silence. Then another soldier repeated the question.From far away, I replied. How about you? They were all from around Damascus.Have you come to Syria for the jihad? someone asked.How long have you been with Jebhat? he asked.The four fighters stared at me. They mumbled among themselves, and then the lieutenant in charge told me not to say anything else. He motioned to me to follow him to a place where we could speak in private. When we were out of his troops hearing, he fixed me with a serious stare.You are American? he asked. Evidently a rumor had reached him.During these two years, he said, you have been able to speak to your family?Not a word, I said. He kept staring into my eyes and narrowing his own, as if he was reviewing some painful fact or memory. Did he suspect me of lying? Was he angry at the Nusra Front? I couldnt tell.I studied Arabic for two years in Damascus, I said. I love the Syrian people. He nodded. And no, I continued, no talking to my family for a very long time. He nodded again, then knit his hands together behind his back.May God open the way for you, he mumbled and walked away.I returned to the F.S.A. troops. One told me that his unit had recently traveled to Jordan to receive training from American forces in fighting groups like the Nusra Front.Really? I said. The Americans? I hope it was good training.The fighters stared at me. I stared at them.After a few moments, I asked, About this business of fighting Jebhat al Nusra?Oh, that, one said. We lied to the Americans about that.Back at the Nusra Fronts camp, I spent most of my time lying on a blanket in the sand, surrounded by five fighters. We snacked on M.R.E. junk food, tossed our candy wrappers into the wind and waited for the Man of Learning to issue orders. The fighters hardly paid attention to me. They had been away from home for a week, an eternity for young Syrians, and were anxious to find out what was happening back in Deir al-Zour. They wandered along the ridgeline, searching for a cellphone signal. When they got one, we got news: We learned that the Islamic State assumed control of the city in the days after we abandoned it, staged a handful of Hilux-and-black-flag victory parades and confiscated a car belonging to the father of one of the Nusra Front fighters.One evening, a foot soldier named Abu Farouk came by our blanket with a watermelon. The Islamic State, he said, had instituted a new law throughout Deir al-Zour province: Upon entering a mosque, all males over 13 were to repent. Good Muslims, the group decreed, should have battled the Nusra Front while it ruled the province. If the males of the province repented, they might carry on as before. But if they refused or if the Islamic State deemed their repentance insincere, they could be killed. Nusra Front fighters were to be shot on sight.I was curious about the futures of the five people now responsible for looking after me. What if they retired from military life, I asked, went home and promised to obey the Islamic State in the future? Would the group still wish to kill them?Because we are Jebhat al Nusra, they replied.I knew the answer to the next question but asked it anyway. Your practice of Islam is exactly the same as ISIS  you admire the same scholars and interpret the Quran just as they do?Yes, they agreed. All of this is true.And its true, I said, that when you joined Al Qaeda, in the early goings of the revolution, ISIS did not exist?Yes, this is so, the fighters agreed.But the situation is absurd, I said. Youre like a guy on the street drinking a bottle of Pepsi. Along comes the Seven-Up salesman. Wicked man! says the Seven-Up salesman. How dare you drink Pepsi? You must die. Under the circumstances, it ought to be O.K. for you to reply: Im quite sorry, sir. But when I went into the store, there was only one brand of soft drink available. Pepsi. Thats what I bought. Wheres the problem?  The foot soldiers, all in their 20s and early 30s, were regular cola drinkers and were happy I had put the matter in everyday commercial terms. Everyone laughed.The real issue between the Nusra Front and the Islamic State was that their commanders, former friends from Iraq, were unable to agree on how to share the revenue from the oil fields in eastern Syria that the Nusra Front had conquered. On the one hand, I was pleased by this. It made the men despise each other. Had their armies reconciled, I would have become the prisoner of a reunited fundamentalist organization under the command of the stronger of the leaders, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State. Even before the recent beheadings, I was unenthusiastic about this prospect. On the other hand, the violence had taken a heavy toll. For six months, I watched the number of young fighters responsible for me dwindle. This one had taken a snipers bullet between the eyes. That one had vanished in a checkpoint suicide bombing. Another had stumbled into an Islamic State checkpoint and was shot on the spot. On and on, from week to week, the blood flowed. I knew exactly why these young men were dying: because the commanders said they must. In addition, the fighters told me, both sides believe that 50,000 years ago, Allah decreed that they should die in exactly this way, at exactly this instant in history.For the moment, however, the Islamic State seemed to have the edge in the recruitment battle. Many of the Nusra Front soldiers told me that over the previous months, their siblings and cousins had been fighting for the Islamic State. The pay was better. And the Islamic State, a stronger army, had won victories across eastern Syria and Iraq. Once, during my time in Deir al-Zour, the commanders put me in a cell with five disfavored members of the Nusra Front. These prisoners were accused of having defected or wishing to defect to the Islamic State. They denied this, but when the guards were far away, they told me that any Nusra Front fighter wishing to become an Islamic State fighter had only to make a few phone calls. He would be required to whisper certain words about the greatness of Baghdadi. In that instant, the fighters history would be forgiven. The next day, he would meet his new commanding officer in a mosque or a restaurant. He would be given a new name and a new cellphone, and his life would begin again.During most of the summer, the siren song wasnt especially loud, but by the time we reached the outskirts of Damascus, it was becoming stronger. It was clear, even to the foot soldiers, that our voyage was no glorious operation on the path of God. Its purpose probably wasnt to retake the Golan Heights either, though rumors to this effect had circulated through the caravan. It was nothing less than an abandonment of the oil fields, the military bases, the prisons and everything else the Nusra Front had worked to control for some two and a half years. We had made a dash for our lives.That night as we finished Abu Farouks watermelon and were gazing up at the stars, I listened to the fighters musing about their futures. Hey, Abu Petra, they asked me, what is Sweden like? If they were to present themselves as Syrian dissidents to the authorities, what would happen next? Was I familiar with the procedures in Sweden for seeking political asylum? And what about Berlin, supposing they found their way to Germany? How long would it take for them to learn German?I listened to their woolgathering for a while, and then some artillery rumbled in the distance. A silence settled over the group. As the fighters around me breathed their first sleep-breaths, I couldnt help feeling that soon a commander would look at them and nod in the direction of incoming fire, and they would toss away their lives as casually as they tossed their M.R.E. trash into the wind. I worried, too, about this: What if the Man of Learning were to nod at me? I knew a lot of the Nusra Fronts operational details. I knew many of the more important fighters. I knew what went on in their jails. What if the Man of Learning were to decide that I knew too much? What if someone were to send him an email informing him that Abu Petra was actually Theo, and that Theo had studied in Yemeni mosques and written about the experience, like a secret observer? What would I do then?In mid-July, the Nusra Front caravan finally arrived at a villa in Saida, a suburb of Daraa. Every day, the Man of Learning told me he would send me home soon. It will happen next Tuesday, he told me. Tuesday came and went. The fiction I now maintained with the Man of Learning was that I was a journalist again, that he would explain himself to the West in an on-camera interview and send me back with the video on a flash drive. At night, when he returned from his daily travels, I would smile and say, When, sheikh, is it going to happen? He would grin. Soon, soon, he would say.One morning in August, when the fighters guarding me were asleep, I took a bag of trash into a courtyard as I normally did. As I slipped out, a fighter, his voice thick with sleep, murmured, When you come back in, close the door. I did, and waited for him to lose consciousness. A half-hour later, having stuffed the Vermont manuscript deep into my jihadi trousers, I tiptoed out.By this point, I knew better than to seek refuge among the moderates of the Free Syrian Army. I asked a passing motorcyclist to take me to a hospital. At the hospital, a dour-looking man greeted me. I am a journalist, I said. From Ireland. Please, you must help me. I love the Syrian people.Dont worry, he said. I am the F.S.A. He admitted me to an inner room. No one comes in here without my leave, he said. You can relax. You are safe. I asked if I could contact my family. Of course, he said. The easiest way, he said, was for me to send an email. But the man with the computers password was away. It would take just a few minutes for him to get to the hospital. Did I need tea? Medical attention?The F.S.A. soldier stepped out. Ten minutes later, he returned, beckoning me with the index finger of his right hand. He seemed to do it in slow motion, as a jailer might summon an innocent prisoner to his execution.In the front hallway of the hospital stood a group of about 15 Nusra Front fighters, Kalashnikovs dangling from their right hands. No one spoke. A few seconds passed, and then someone said in a barely audible voice, Come, American.They drove me back to the villa. They hit me a bit in the car, and then, on arriving in the living room where the guards had been dozing an hour before, they flung me onto the carpet. The Man of Learning sat cross-legged on a sofa. Who has handcuffs? he asked. Someone cuffed my hands. The Man of Learning grinned. You are a Nazarene liar and a sneak, Bitar, he said. This afternoon, I will execute you by my own hand.I spent much of the following weeks locked inside a bedroom in the villa. The Man of Learning did not allow the guards to seek their revenge; he fired them and appointed more competent but kinder guards. As I waited for something to happen, I sat by a window and worked on my Vermont novel. Every once in a while, I watched Assads airplanes bomb our neighborhood. My mind kept circling back, as it still does, to the endlessness of the violence in the country.Earlier, in March, the Nusra Front commanders in Deir al-Zour put a pair of Islamic State commanders in the cells on either side of mine. Because their religious learning was beyond question, the jail administrators allowed us to speak, provided it was about Islam. During this period, I occasionally brought up the You killed my men, I must kill yours logic in which the Muslims of the region seemed trapped. My cell neighbors were well placed to have an opinion. Abu Dhar, on my left, previously of Al Qaeda in Iraq, subsequently of the Nusra Front, lately of the Islamic State, had been a weapons trafficker. Abu Amran, on my right, had the same credentials and bragged of having been responsible for explosions that killed dozens  perhaps hundreds  of Syrians and Iraqis.But surely, I said, this violence is not good for Islam. They temporized. In their view, the fight between Baghdadi and the Man of Learning amounted to mere childishness. Abu Dhar and Abu Amran were almost too embarrassed to speak of it. Yet the explosions and sniper killings that both groups espoused were justifiable  even wise. Assad was bound to slink away into the undergrowth. The battle against his forces was just a skirmish in the great global combat to come, in which the believers would prevail against the unbelievers.After we conquer Jerusalem, we will conquer Rome, Abu Amran told me.No one is trying to conquer you, I said. Why do you want to conquer everybody?The conquerors had come to Syria in the past, Abu Amran answered. They are sure to come again. He spoke of the oil fields over which the West slavered, the archaeological treasures and the rise of Islam, which the worlds governments  all of them unbelievers, especially the Middle Eastern ones  could not abide.If Obama bombs the believers here, we will bomb you there, Abu Amran told me. We have our Tomahawk missiles too, they said, referring to human beings. Over the last 22 months, I had stopped being surprised when Nusra Front commanders introduced their 8-year-old sons to me by saying, He will be a suicide martyr someday, by the will of God. The children participated in the torture sessions. Around the prisons, they wore large pouches with red wires sticking out of them  apparently suicide belts  and sang their destroy the Jews, death to America anthems in the hallways. It would be a mistake to assume that only Syrians are educating their children in this manner. The Nusra Front higher-ups were inviting Westerners to the jihad in Syria not so much because they needed more foot soldiers  they didnt  but because they want to teach the Westerners to take the struggle into every neighborhood and subway station back home. They want these Westerners to train their 8-year-olds to do the same. Over time, they said, the jihadists would carve mini-Islamic emirates out of the Western countries, as the Islamic State had done in Syria and Iraq. There, Western Muslims would at last live with dignity, under a true Quranic dispensation.During my discussions with senior Nusra Front fighters, I would force them to confront the infinity of violence that this dream implied. O.K., perhaps you have a point, they would say. Anyway, we only want to dispense with Bashar. We must build our caliphate here first. Provided the West doesnt kill us, we wont kill you.Will your caliphate have schools? I would ask. Hospitals? Roads?Yes, of course. But not one of them seemed interested in repairing the mile after mile of destroyed cityscape encountered during any voyage in Syria. Not one seemed interested in recruiting teachers and doctors  or at least the kinds of teachers and doctors whose reading ventured beyond the Quran. They wanted bigger, more spectacular explosions. They wanted fleets of Humvees. Humvees dont need roads.One day in August, a guard told me about a picnic he recently had with his family in the Golan Heights. The U.N. soldiers, he said, were close enough to reach out and touch. During the following days, small groups of Nusra Front fighters, most of whom I recognized from my time in Deir al-Zour, carried away items from a pile of munitions  artillery shells, sacks of bullets, launching tubes for rocket-propelled grenades  that had been left on a concrete slab. In the evenings, I was sometimes invited to lounge near the weapons with visiting emirs. The United Nations role in the Golan Heights was occasionally discussed in predictable terms: The U.N. was an instrument by which world powers oppressed the Muslims of Syria. It was a tool of the Jews. I yawned during these discussions. Why must they always recite Qaeda company policy at me? I thought.Not long after, a half-dozen top-level Nusra Front members arrived for a meeting. Most had the James Foley execution video on their cellphones. Did you see it? they asked me, laughing and waving their phones. Did I want to see it again? They were in a buoyant mood. Hey, Bitar, you American! they called to me. You see what ISIS does to people? What if it happens to you? Would you like that?A few days later, on the afternoon of Aug. 24, the Man of Learning made an unexpected visit. Get your things, he told me. Were going to send you to your mama now. I had long ago said goodbye to my mother in private nighttime telepathic conversations. I didnt believe  I didnt allow myself to believe  that I would see her again.In my bedroom-cell, an attendant who had been kind to me helped me get ready. I stuffed my Vermont novel into my clothing and got into a Hilux with several fighters. A few miles from the villa, the Man of Learning directed my driver to stop. Buy Bitar a new tracksuit and a pair of shoes, he said. This seemed like a good sign. Would he be buying me new clothes if he meant to kill me? Later, as the Golan Heights rose up before the Hiluxs windshield, a fighter named Abu Muthana asked me to say goodbye to Nusra Front fighters in a video hed record on his cellphone. I did so without bitterness. Abu Muthanas friend Mohammed had made jokes about his inability to find a wife during the jihad. Abu Jebel had brought me extra dates during the winter.We stopped under a bank of trees near the Syrian town of Quneitra. To my surprise, two heavy white trucks with the letters U.N. marked in black on their sides stood idling in the shade. Get out, the driver said to me. Take your things.The Man of Learning asked me to approach the truck he was driving. Hey Bitar, he said. Dont say bad things about us in the press.Ill just say whats true, I said.Very good, he said. That is fine.At the U.N. base in the demilitarized zone between Israel and Syria, an Indian doctor had me sit on a table. He asked the attendants to leave the room. He had me remove my trousers. With the gentlest, most silent, most breathtaking courtesy, he examined my body. That broke my heart. A representative of the United States government greeted me on the far side of the Israeli border. In the back seat of an immaculate dark-blue S.U.V., she put her hand on my shoulder. Its O.K. to cry, she said.I later learned that the Qataris helped engineer my release, as they have for others kidnapped in the region. But in those first moments, it felt to me that I had escaped from Al Qaeda by an incalculable miracle. I allowed myself to think, at last, that everything was going to be all right. Several days later, I received word that the Nusra Front had attacked the U.N. base where I had been so gently examined.", "source": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "date": "2014-11-04T00:16:38Z", "top_image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/02/magazine/02Padnos_ss-slide-FJKV/02Padnos_ss-slide-FJKV-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "id": 4758}, {"title": "ISIS: Killing leader might not help (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/29/opinion/baer-isis-assassination/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Robert Baer is a CNN national security analyst, a former CIA operative and author of 'The Perfect Kill: 21 Laws for Assassins.' The views expressed are his own.(CNN) -- It's a good bet that right now, someone somewhere in Washington has come up with a plan to decapitate the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by assassinating its boss, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and moving down through his lieutenants.Argued in hushed tones over a polished conference table, I have no doubt this sounds like a no-lose proposition (and certainly a better alternative to invading Iraq and Syria). But if ISIS is in essence al Qaeda 2.0, then it is hard not to see the assassination of Osama bin Laden as having had very mixed results -- and as holding some important lessons for U.S. policy makers.The fact is that assassinations are, at best, tricky -- the cure can be worse than the disease. And a cure is almost certain to fail when you have absolutely no idea what the disease is that you're treating.It may comfort us to dismiss ISIS as a group of bloodthirsty terrorists doomed to collapse under their own psychosis and violence. But while ISIS does of course employ terror as a tactic, getting hung up on the word 'terror' causes us to miss a more critical truth: that ISIS is a straight-line manifestation of an aggrieved religious sect -- orthodox Sunni Islam. And it's becoming more apparent by the day that a lot of Sunni Muslims believe they're on the losing end of history, and that if they don't hit back, things will get a lot worse.Indeed, Sunnis, despite making up the large majority of Muslims globally, haven't fared well in recent times. The 2003 invasion of Iraq dispossessed the Sunnis in that country of both their power and wealth. Insult was added to injury when the United States handed power over to a sectarian Shia government bent on revenge against the Sunnis.We can go on all we like about democracy and the rule of law, but the way the Sunnis view it is that we wantonly empowered their Shia rivals.Sunnis aren't doing much better anywhere else. The minority Alawite regime in Syria -- the Alawites are a Shia offshoot -- continues to slaughter large numbers of Sunnis. Another Shia offshoot sect in Yemen recently took over Sana, the capital. And for the last decade, the American drone campaign over Pakistan's tribal belt has never let up, 'breaking the back' of al Qaeda and the Taliban.We may dismiss them as terrorists, but for a small but growing number of Sunnis they're the closest thing they have to a resistance group. Even in solidly Sunni Egypt, the military is doing its best to crush the Muslim Brotherhood, the beating heart of political Sunni Islam.An international aid worker who's negotiated with ISIS on hostage releases recently told me that militant Muslims look at their predicament in the starkest of existential terms, namely that that the United States is out to destroy Islam. They're convinced the U.S. deliberately caused the death of 300,000 Muslims in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and in retaliation for 9/11, and that it won't stop until the Sunnis start to fight back.Everything to know about the rise of ISISThere is of course no American conspiracy against Sunni Islam. But the point is that ISIS is rooted in an embattled religious sect that's had enough. Call it a Sunni intifadah, if you like -- a lashing out in frustration and fear. The fury of the impotent. But, unlike the Palestinian intifada against Israeli authority, this one promises to be more enduring and disruptive, if for no other reason than a resurgent Sunni Islam is bound to run headlong into Shia Islam, and along with it the real possibility of a hundred-years war.While most Sunnis may want nothing to do with ISIS's apocalyptic jihad, coexisting with the Shia is less and less appealing to them.A year ago, when ISIS started to move across the border from Syria into Iraq, I took the pulse of a couple Sunni Iraqi tribal sheiks and officers from Saddam Hussein's army, asking them why they didn't drive them back into Syria. After all, they have the arms and people to do it. Did they really want to live side by side with frenzied jihadists and risk Baghdad strafing them with American-supplied Cobra helicopters?Who is the ISIS?Their uniform response was that they would ally with anyone, including the madmen of ISIS, to drive the Shia government of Baghdad out of Sunni areas. They added that secession from Shia Baghdad was all but inevitable. Some said that if history favored them, they would unite with the Sunnis of Syria to form a single nation. As for ISIS and the jihadists, they would turn on them when the time came.Letting the jihadists serve as your spearhead may sound risky to us, but what it tell us is that the divide between Iraq's Sunnis and Shia is truly unbridgeable. To be sure, we're capable of militarily destroying ISIS and eliminating its leadership. But Sunni grievances will remain -- and there will always be another Sunni strongman to take up the cudgel.Which brings me to this: the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement gave the world the Middle East's modern borders. Drawn up in secret by French and British colonial administrators, those borders had -- and still have -- nothing to do with cultural and ethnic realities. This begs the question of whether it is really in our interests to defend artificial borders by waging endless war and campaigns of political murder.The fact is that we are likely living what amount to the final agonies of the Ottoman Empire. If that's the case, drone assassinations and targeted killings will get us absolutely nowhere.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T22:51:36Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141029170009-isis-flags-story-top.jpg", "id": 4058}, {"title": "Rare Footage of Raqqa, Syria, Shows Calm Streets in ISIS' Capital", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/rare-footage-raqqa-syria-shows-calm-streets-isis-capital-n225261", "text": "There are few obvious signs of anything out of the ordinary in ISIS' capital city.

A later statement said one bundle went astray but was destroyed to prevent it falling into enemy hands, and that all the others were safely delivered.But a video uploaded to the internet by a media group loyal to IS showed a cache of weapons, apparently dropped by the US, in militant hands.Activists from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said militants had seized one cache.Rear Adm Kirby said he could not confirm that the video was authentic.'They are certainly of the kinds of material that was dropped... so it's not out of the realm of the possible in that regard,' he said.'When we have something definitive that we can provide in terms of an assessment on that we'll do that,' he said.The IS advance in Syria takes place against the backdrop of the civil war.

'The important thing is for all of us to absolutely reject this death cult,' he said.Some Australian media reports suggested a leadership dispute at the Islamic center could have been the reason behind the attack, but Daoud rejected the notion, saying the dispute was being litigated in the courts and it was highly unlikely that it would take a violent turn.A New South Wales police spokesman said there was nothing to add beyond the police's initial statement calling for public information on the shooting.Abbott's government has been a strident supporter of U.S. efforts to combat the Sunni extremist group, which controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq.It has deployed jets and military troops in the fight, introduced controversial legislation to imprison Australians found to be fighting abroad or supporting terrorist actions, and conducted large-scale anti-terror raids, claiming to have disrupted a plot to kidnap and behead a random member of the public.Authorities believe around 60 Australians are fighting in the conflict in Syria and Iraq, with around 100 more working in support roles within Australia.But Daoud said he was yet to see the fruits of Abbott's tough talk about reining in Australia's radicalized Muslim youth.'We thought a lot of the radical Islamic centers would be closed, well-known extremists would be rounded up and put behind bars,' he said. 'It's all talk.'Sectarian tensions were a new phenomenon for Australia's Muslim community, said Rifi.During previous periods when Australian Muslims had felt under attack -- such as in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Bali bombings or the Cronulla riots -- they had bonded together under a common identity.But now many in the community felt doubly under fire -- from sectarian agitators and from 'rednecks' in the wider public, said Daoud.Rifi said that from the early days of the Syrian conflict, Sunni extremists had inflamed community tensions by attempting to 'name and shame' businesses on social media that were run by members of Alawite sect, to which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad belongs.'They will use any excuse to create division,' he said.Rifi said he remained optimistic. 'The forces that pull us apart are increasing in strength, but they are nowhere as strong as the forces that pull us together,' he said.But Daoud did not believe things would improve soon.'It is a very tough time, and we expect it to become more tough,' he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:48:22Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141106104908-australia-hijab-mural-story-top.jpg", "id": 6122}, {"title": "Egypt imposes state of emergency in Sinai after attacks", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29766945", "text": "Egypt has declared a three-month state of emergency in parts of the Sinai Peninsula after at least 31 soldiers were killed in two attacks there.President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has declared three days of mourning in the wake of the suspected jihadist attacks.Egypt's Rafah crossing into the Gaza Strip was also closed, state TV said.It was the biggest loss of life in decades for Egypt's army, which has been carrying out an offensive against jihadists in northern Sinai.The area has become increasingly lawless since President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in 2011.

Anderson and his band of Confederate guerrillas had raised hell all over central Missouri, burning and killing with abandon. Finally, on Oct. 26, just outside of Albany, Mo., they ran into the 33rd Infantry, Enrolled Missouri Militia.Andersons men had made short work of state militia units before, and they left a steadily growing trail of dead Union men behind them to prove it. But the 33rd Infantry, under the command of Lt. Col. Samuel P. Cox, was no typical state militia, but a group of troopers specifically trained to track down and eliminate the guerrilla captain known as Bloody Bill.The fighting pitted Andersons 80 or so battle-hardened men against Coxs 350 soldiers. The engagement began on horseback but soon spilled into the streets of Albany, as a sizable portion of the 33rd dismounted and took cover in the town. Anderson, undeterred by a fortified Union position, led a determined charge against the dismounted militiamen. The assault failed, and the guerrillas broke away to regroup.Then, inexplicably, Anderson, with just one other man in tow, dashed recklessly through the federal line. Two shots rang out; a pair of mini balls burrowed deep into Andersons brain. The most dangerous man in Missouri was lifeless by the time he hit the ground.This wasnt the first time Union authorities had believed Anderson dead. A month before, on Sept. 30, 1864, First Lt. Thomas Wright of the Fifth Missouri State Cavalry filed a triumphant report claiming to have killed Anderson in the midst of a large skirmish. Wright had even recruited locals in Waynesville, Mo., to identify the body and verify his trophy. Intentionally or otherwise, all involved were mistaken. Two weeks later, Anderson confirmed his liveliness by beating a wealthy Union supporter in Glasgow, Mo., to death for manumitting slaves.With this in mind, Cox was overly cautious to identify the corpse beyond doubt. Excitement notwithstanding, no one wanted to repeat Wrights unfortunate performance. On Andersons body, Cox found documents and correspondence addressed directly to the guerrilla captain from Sterling Price, a former Missouri governor and now a Confederate general.A timepiece and six revolvers were taken from Andersons corpse and awarded to Coxs officers as mementos. The body was then transported to Richmond, Mo., and led through the streets by a parade of Union soldiers and sympathetic onlookers. As the celebratory cavalcade wound down, Andersons corpse was then photographed, with the image later featured on postcards and other souvenir knickknacks.When it was finally time to inter Anderson, federal soldiers first removed the rest of his jewelry  cutting off one of his fingers in the process  and then hastily buried the body in a nearby field. Nothing resembling a proper funeral took place until 1908 when a guerrilla-turned-outlaw, Cole Younger, fresh out of prison in Northfield, Minn., organized a belated service for his old commander.The martial circumstances and public excitement that surrounded Andersons demise raise a few obvious questions. Why did the Union brass assemble a special squadron to hunt down a single guerrilla? Why was killing Anderson a trophy-worthy accomplishment for the Union officers present? And why did the transport and burial of Andersons corpse elicit so much fanfare? In other words: Why was killing William T. Anderson such a big deal?In late 1863 the band of guerrillas under William C. Quantrill, who had been terrorizing the region for months, rode to Texas to set up winter quarters. Among them were Anderson, with Frank James, Cole Younger and a host of other well-known Missouri bushwhackers. The group was infamous for massacring more than 150 civilians in Lawrence, Kan., that August. But in the months following the raid, Quantrills ability to control his men had deteriorated considerably. As infighting took its toll, rivalries boiled over; the more ambitious of Quantrills lieutenants grew frustrated, broke away and took charge of their own splinter companies.When Bill Anderson returned from Texas in 1864, he rode at the head of his own band of guerrillas. Over the next several months, they tore their own path through the state, plundering the tiny village of Centralia, murdering 25 unarmed Union soldiers returning home on furlough and killing another 125 during an engagement with the 39th Missouri Infantry  all on the same day. Before leaving the site of the days second massacre, Anderson and his comrades allegedly collected scalps to commemorate their victory.In the annals of guerrilla history, it is Quantrill, Andersons former superior and chief rival, who gets the lions share of attention, both scholarly and popular. Given Quantrills track record as a guerrilla commander from 1861 to 1863, this is not particularly surprising. The Lawrence Massacre was an unprecedented event in the history of American warfare, and Quantrill is typically credited as its mastermind. After the war John Newman Edwards, a firebrand Democratic pundit, wrote Noted Guerrillas, or, The Warfare of the Border, which is largely responsible for establishing Quantrill as the greatest Confederate guerrilla leader. Quantrill, Edwards wrote, was unlike them all, just as he was greater than them all.Anderson, on the other hand, is often portrayed as a reckless, if not bloodthirsty or psychopathic, enigma. He is well known in the Border West  but more as an oddity of nature than an effective insurgent leader. Nonetheless while Quantrills star may have risen after the war, by fall 1864, after Quantrills band had splintered and after the ghastly bloodletting at Centralia, it was Anderson whom Missouri Unionists viewed as the most dangerous guerrilla threat in their state.This is not to say that William Quantrill isnt the best-known or most emblematic figure of the wider guerrilla war. But beyond that shroud of hindsight and symbolism, as the violence unfolded on a daily basis, he was hardly alone. Indeed, the memory of Quantrill as the leading guerrilla obscures the variety and number of guerrilla threats to the region.A more nuanced understanding of guerrilla warfare as a dynamic, evolving system  one in which relationships among the guerrillas themselves mattered, and in which the impact of irregular activity on the federal war effort is assessed collectively and over time  sheds new light on Andersons controversial legacy. To be sure, that legacy will always include the massacres, the scalping and the charges of mental instability. But as we note the 150th anniversary of his death, it should also focus as much on Bloody Bill Andersons very real impact on the daily wartime experiences of Missourians and on broader military strategies in a bitterly divided Border State.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Matthew C.

The group has been defending three small Kurdish statelets in northern Syria. The Kurdish militants have also spent much of the last year battling ISIS, the hardline jihadist group that wants to create an Islamic state across parts of Iraq and Syria.'Due to two years of almost no foreign policy in the region -- while these people threatened American citizens, and bring harm to us -- I think I decided enough was enough, and I decided to come out this way,' Matson said.He saw the fall of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, as a turning point.'All of the American brothers that have died over there -- all the American veterans that have died over there -- and paid their lives for that country so they could have a democracy. That just resonated in my mind. And I couldn't live with myself letting that country fall, and all my brothers' lives be for nothing,' Matson said.But instead of ending up in Iraq, Matson joined the YPG in Syria.It marked a dramatic turn for the former soldier. During more than two years in the U.S. military, Matson says, he never saw combat, nor was he shipped overseas to serve.In Syria, he saw action almost as soon as he arrived.Two days after reaching the Kurdish enclave known as Rojava, he says, he was hit by a mortar round during a firefight with ISIS.Now mostly recovered from shrapnel wounds, but still squinting occasionally from the wounds caused by the dirt that the mortar shell sprayed in his eye, Matson met CNN in the YPG-controlled town of Al-Malikiyah.'All my life, I've wanted to be a soldier. So it just fits well over here,' he said. 'I'm at peace being here.''Taking the fight to the enemy'Matson is from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, a 'mom and pop town' as he described it, with just a few restaurants and three gas stations.He worked the third shift at a food packaging company but missed military life. Matson said he was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in 2007. Because of problems with his record, he says the military refused to take him back, despite his multiple efforts to re-enlist.'Civilian life just wasn't for me. The normal 9-to-5, I just wasn't comfortable with it,' he said. 'Over here, everything makes sense.'Matson got in contact with the YPG on Facebook. He prayed about what to do for a month or two, he said, before making the leap.He flew to Turkey, where he was picked up and taken to Rojava, a Kurdish-controlled area of northern Syria.Matson misses a few things about the United States: hamburgers, toilets, rock 'n' roll.But he wouldn't change where he is for anything. He speaks about the Kurdish movement with the fervor of a recent convert.'It's for these people that I'm doing this. Yes, it does help Americans back home, because we're taking the fight to the enemy here, so they can't take it to us. So it's that to a degree. But, for me, it's for the Kurdish people,' Matson said.U.S. airdrops give much needed aid in Kobani, but did ISIS get some?U.S. law enforcement officials say it's illegal for an American to join a Syrian militia, just as it is for an American to join ISIS.According to intelligence estimates, more than 100 of the foreign fighters for ISIS in Syria have come from the United States.Canadian authorities believe that 130 Canadian citizens are taking part in jihad. Hundreds more have traveled from Europe. Thousands come from the Middle East and Africa.When asked whether he saw any parallels between those foreign jihadi fighters and himself, Matson said there's nothing he can do to change their minds.'They've come here to push an agenda, to push one way of life over people who do not want it. And I will not sit and stand by while people like that take those actions,' he said.He says he believes the U.S. government is watching what he does, but will not consider him a terrorist, nor deny him re-entry. If that happens, however, Matson says he could just stay in Kurdistan.'Once this fight is over, and ISIS has been crippled, then the next stage of my life, then I'll think about that,' he said.After the rescue: A Yazidi family's harrowing flight to escape ISIS'Someone has to do it'Since recovering from his wounds, Matson has been working to bring other foreign fighters to Syria. He says he's recruiting for the YPG on social media.Most of the people interested are former military, he said.'I've had ex-military ask from Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, you name it. They've been asking. ISIS has threatened all these countries that I've named to push their agenda in those nations, and the veterans of those nations who love their countries don't want to sit by while this is happening,' he said.The YPG are lightly armed guerrilla fighters. Most lack helmets and armor. They rely heavily on Kalashnikov assault rifles. But their ranks have also been reinforced by Kurds from Turkey, many of whom are veterans of a 30-year guerrilla war fought between the Turkish state and a sister organization to the YPG known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The U.S., the European Union and Turkey officially list the PKK as a terrorist organization.The bloodbath in the Middle East has blurred loyalties. This month, the United States began providing air support to YPG fighters defending the Syrian border town of Kobani from an ISIS siege. In addition to bombing ISIS militants in and around Kobani, U.S. military planes parachuted weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters, infuriating the Turkish government.Matson said the YPG could use more support on the ground, in addition to ongoing U.S.-led airstrikes.Although those strikes, he said, have helped to shift the balance of power on the battlefield, he stressed that a lot more needs to be done. As soon as he can, he says, he'll head back to the front line.'The way I look at it is someone has to do it, and if we don't fight, ISIS will grow -- will become more well-funded -- and they will push their agenda. So we need men on the front to take the fight to the enemy before the enemy can take the fight to us,' Matson said.Ivan Watson reported from Rojava. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.

Bowe Bergdahl was released from nearly five years in captivity, yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street, red-bricked storefronts of his hometown. A sense of relief and excitement filled the air: Bergdahl would soon be home.But more than four months after Bergdahl returned to the United States, the ribbons and banners are gone. This town's relationship with the saga of their homegrown prisoner of war is complicated.'We're done. We're over it,' Hailey Mayor Fritz Haemmerle said as he denied CNN's request for an on-camera interview. 'We stood by the Bergdahl family to get Bowe home but we need to move on.'Inside a secure locker of the Hailey Police Department, there are boxes filled with thousands of letters for Bergdahl.The letters were sent to the White House as part of a 'Bring Bowe Home' campaign started through social media last November, just months before Bergdahl would be released.Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, spearheaded the letter campaign. In three months, O'Neill said, several hundred thousand letters poured into the White House. A few of those boxes were eventually shipped to Idaho. O'Neill can't bring herself to throw the letters away.'It means that people all over the world cared about Bowe,' O'Neill said. 'We would hope that he would like to read through them one day to see just how much he meant to so many people.'The boxes are a symbol of how the story of Bergdahl's rescue didn't come with a triumphant homecoming.Bergdahl's release on May 30 was instantly doused in controversy. Many of the soldiers who served with him accused the 28-year-old soldier of deserting his unit by walking off the Afghanistan base before he was captured. There was also intense criticism of the Obama administration for trading Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Bergdahl now sits in a sort of limbo. He has completed the Army's formal reintegration program and continues psychological treatment. He is still assigned to a unit with U.S. Army North in San Antonio, performing 'administrative duties.'But Bergdahl is also waiting to hear if he'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system. In August, he was questioned by Gen. Kenneth Dahl for two days.The Army announced on Friday that Dahl completed the initial report on his findings in the Bergdahl case. The report will now be reviewed by the director of the Army staff and senior Army leaders.'This will be a lengthy process,' an Army spokesman wrote. 'It would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential results or the amount of time the review process will take to complete.'When news of Bergdahl's release broke, his family and friends had hoped for a quick reunion. For nearly five years, the lives of Bergdahl's parents had been consumed by the plight of their son.His father, Bob Bergdahl, has said he kept his clocks set to the time in Afghanistan. He grew a beard, to the dismay of many critics, to show solidarity with his son. Bob Bergdahl also taught himself Pashto, the language of his son's captors, to communicate directly with the Taliban.In the days after his son's release, critics used those details to accuse Bob Bergdahl of sympathizing with the Taliban. Bergdahl's parents have declined all requests for interviews. Family friends say Bob Bergdahl has shaved his beard.But the expected family reunion never materialized and the Bergdahl family soon stopped answering questions about why Bowe Bergdahl was refusing to see his parents.Sources tell CNN that Bergdahl is now 'communicating' with his parents, but a face-to-face reunion still has not occurred. The sources would not elaborate on how Bergdahl is communicating with his family.Military officials have said Bergdahl has been given every opportunity to reunite with his family. Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell, declined to talk about Bergdahl's communication with his family.Bergdahl grew up among a tight-knit community of families in Hailey that home-schooled their children. Tim Kemery's son was one of Bowe's best friends.Kemery said Bowe Bergdahl was raised in an intensely religious atmosphere with a strict code of conduct. Around age 16, Kemery said, Bergdahl left home and embarked on a series of adventures.'No doubt it was some kind of rebellion,' Kemery said.But Kemery couldn't say if that childhood rebellion was still a source of tension between Bergdahl and his family. He said he also wonders why the soldier hasn't reunited with his parents.'There may have been something there that was a bone of contention,' said Kemery. 'Maybe it's the debriefing (reintegration process) or because he feels like he has let them down or for some other unknown reason he just doesn't want to have that emotional recognition again of his parents.'Kemery said that as a child Bergdahl struggled to control his frustration and would often disappear for days at a time, building forts and hiking for miles into the Idaho wilderness.Kemery said he sees a parallel between the young Bowe he knew and the soldier accused by fellow soldiers of walking off his military base in Afghanistan in 2009.'Bowe did have a tendency to get really frustrated and just to walk off and throw up his hands,' said Kemery.Around Hailey, one often hears people asking the same question, will Bowe Bergdahl ever come back home? Bergdahl must wait to hear what military commanders will determine about his fate. Will he be charged with a crime? Will he be discharged?Bergdahl's lawyer has said the soldier would like to continue his education. Tim Kemery hopes he makes time to visit Idaho.'We have a hunting trip waiting for him. We are going to talk about things around the fire,' said Kemery.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-10-15T05:01:00Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141014203023-erin-dnt-lavandera-bergdahl-00002024-story-top.jpg", "id": 821}, {"title": "Fight for Kobani intensifies; ISIS takes Iraq base", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/13/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- The battle for a key Syrian city on the Turkish border intensified Monday as ISIS continued its push for control of Kobani while also scoring a victory in neighboring Iraq, taking a strategically important military base in Anbar province.A fighter from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, told CNN's Arwa Damon that the battle in Kobani concerned the main border crossing into Turkey. If ISIS took control, he said, 'it's over.'The fighter said the Kurdish fighters had pushed back an attempted advance by ISIS on Monday morning but that it would be 'impossible' for them to hold their ground if current conditions continued.Should they take Kobani, the militants would control three official border crossings between Turkey and Syria and a stretch of the border about 60 miles (97 kilometers) long.Monday has been one of the most violent days in Kobani since ISIS launched its assault on the Syrian city, with sounds of fierce fighting, including gunfire and explosions, CNN staff on the Syria-Turkey border said.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh described seeing a mushroom cloud rising about 100 meters (nearly 330 feet) above the city in an area targeted by at least four blasts, generally after the sound of jets overhead.'However, it remains unclear who is gaining the upper hand,' Walsh said. 'Distribution of the airstrikes does not immediately suggest the Kurds are retaking the center so far.'The U.S. military said it and its partners had attacked ISIS on Sunday and Monday, launching four airstrikes southwest of Kobani, three northeast of the city and one northwest of Raqqa, Syria.'Fighter aircraft from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated in these airstrikes. All aircraft exited the strike areas safely,' the military said in a statement.U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that Turkey had agreed to allow the United States and its partners to use bases and territory to train.'They have said that their facilities inside Turkey can be used by coalition forces, American and otherwise, to engage in activities inside Iraq and Syria,' Rice told NBC's 'Meet the Press.''That's a new commitment and one that we very much welcome,' she said.However, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency quoted the country's foreign minister as saying Monday: 'Turkey has not made any decision on whether to open its Incirlik airbase' to coalition forces in the fight against the militant group.Read: Turkey willing to put troops in Syria 'if others do their part'Despite airstrikes by the United States and its allies in Iraq over the weekend, reports suggest ISIS has continued to gain ground in Anbar province and has encircled Haditha, the province's last large town not yet under its control.Provincial security force sources told CNN on Monday that Iraqi forces had abandoned a strategically important base in Anbar after heavy fighting with the militants.The base outside Hit was one of the Shiite-led government's few remaining military outposts in Anbar, a predominantly Sunni province. It is a key control point for roads running through the region.The Iraqi military still controls the Ayn al-Asad military base, which helps defend Iraq's second-largest dam and the provincial capital of Ramadi.About 80% of Anbar is under ISIS control, according to Sabah Al-Karhout, president of the Anbar Provincial Council. The group's presence has been bolstered by as many as 10,000 fighters, dispatched from Syria and northern Iraq, the provincial council said. Anbar is about the size of North Dakota.On Sunday, the leader of U.S. military efforts to fight ISIS in Iraq said the terror group came within 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) of Baghdad's airport.Should all of Anbar fall, the Sunni extremists would rule from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria, at least, according to the deputy head of the provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi. ISIS would control a swath 350 miles (563 kilometers) long.Anbar leaders on Saturday appealed for U.S. ground forces to help them fight ISIS, but Baghdad said it had not received any official request.The Iraqi government has been adamant that it does not want U.S. forces on the ground, and President Barack Obama has not shown any intent to deploy any.In new violence Monday evening, three explosions rocked three predominantly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, killing at least 17 people and injuring 59 others, security and medical sources told CNN.In the first, an improvised explosive device detonated in Sadr City, killing six people and wounding 24. A suicide attack at the entrance to the Khadimiya neighborhood in northern Baghdad left nine dead and 29 injured. In a third blast, a car bomb attack in northern Baghdad killed two people and wounded six others.Also Monday, a motorcycle with explosives was detonated in front of a restaurant in Kirkuk. One civilian and two police officers died in the explosion in the northern Iraqi city's Al-Qadissia section, said two government officials who could not be named for security reasons.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-15T02:07:36Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141013131025-kobani-blast-october-13-story-top.jpg", "id": 204}, {"title": "The week in 37 photos", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/24/world/gallery/week-in-photos-1024/index.html", "text": "In this photo provided by Canadian politician Nina Grewal, members of Canada's Parliament barricade themselves in a meeting room Wednesday, October 22, after shots were fired on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.

He previously spent 15 years working for the Australian government in national security, within the military, police and intelligence operations.Canberra (CNN) -- The Australian prime minister's hard-line plan to throw foreign fighters and ISIS supporters into maximum security prison is finally coming to fruition.The country's parliament passed the controversial Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill on Thursday, which will make it easier for police and security agencies to apprehend alleged terrorist suspects (and supporters) and detain them without explanation, potentially leading to lengthy prison sentences.The new legislation is designed to inhibit would-be fighters from traveling overseas to join conflicts. It will also subject foreign fighters and individuals who have been in conflict areas to a range of controls upon their return to Australia. The laws will also incarcerate individuals who 'advocate terrorism.'In reality, the laws lower the threshold for arresting people on alleged terrorism offenses and will potentially lead to innocent individuals being arrested and detained.Australia's approach is contradictory to other national governments' anti-terrorism tactics and may actually be counterproductive. Its new legislation could increase the risk of terrorism by further alienating marginalized youth who have toyed with the idea of associating with terrorists or committing violent acts in the name of ISIS.The Danish government, for example, is developing diversionary programs that see some foreign fighters handled on a case-by-case basis and potentially offered rehabilitation without prison time. In the UK, terror suspects could be placed under a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims), which will force some to engage in de-radicalization programs. Tpims are court orders that place restrictions on the movements and activities of suspects where there is insufficient evidence to bring charges.Both of these programs differentiate between the types of terrorist offenders. For example, those that have committed terrorist violence; those that are preparing for an act; those that support the idea of an Islamic state but not violence; and those that claim membership for other motives.In Australia, one might only have to brag about supporting or belonging to a terrorist group to potentially end up in prison for up to five years.Playing the Australian coalition government's usual national security trump card, the laws were rushed through parliament, with inadequate time to be properly developed and scrutinized. Muslim groups, lawyers, human rights groups and academics have all urged the government to delay passing the legislation due to human rights issues, to no avail.The new legislation targets Australians who engage in conflicts in foreign countries and seek to return home, and criminalizes travel to areas designated by Australia's Foreign Minister as 'no go' zones on the grounds that a terrorist organization operates within it.The designation power is broad and allows the proscription of entire countries or regions spanning two or more countries. The offense carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.Given their breadth, the laws do not merely affect foreign fighters but also, potentially, people who may have traveled to designated areas for a range of other reasons -- such as visiting or caring for families, performing humanitarian aid work, or undertaking official or journalistic duties.The new laws also make it an offense to 'advocate terrorism' with offenders potentially facing lengthy jail terms if they 'counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act.' Prior to the new legislation, authorities 'had to 'believe' a terror crime was about to be committed'.Under the new legislation, police only 'have to 'suspect' a crime is to be committed to be able to detain and charge someone.' Police could now act the moment people start advocating terrorism, effectively implying that they are guilty well before the reality of a violent crime being committed.The Australian teenager Abdullah Elmir, who recently appeared in a YouTube video released by ISIS threatening Australian and allied nations, is one of the targets of the new legislation.But other cases may be less clear. Within the group of ISIS supporters here in Australia, it isn't hard to come across some marginalized Muslim youth who simply claim to support ISIS. However, the depth of their radicalization is shallow and they appear naive about the real conditions of conflict and Islamic State violence. Like many other defiant teenagers, being part of a gang or group of any type can provide protection and a sense of belonging.While such cases might look like instances of advocating terrorism, in reality, their relationship to terrorism is superficial. Teenagers pledging allegiance to ISIS seems merely to serve as a way to lift their social standing among their networks, at school or in their community. In their minds, such claimed allegiance makes them strong and invincible. It would be fair to say that their claims of support for ISIS comes with little consideration for its wider consequences, such as potentially ending up in the judicial system.Among those who have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq, many may have not liked what they have witnessed and want to return to Australia.Not all will come back as hardened terrorists. There will be some that have already disengaged from supporting ISIS because they have been disillusioned by what they have seen in Syria or Iraq. There will be others who have traveled to fight to support their Muslim brothers but who pose no threat to Australia and still consider themselves Australian.Given such wide differentiation, the Australian government must be careful in the development of its anti-terrorism legislation not to lump everyone in the same basket. Not everyone sympathetic to ISIS goes on to become a violent extremist, nor have they all committed violent acts.For supporters who stayed at home, the main objective should be to divert them from police attention, the courts and incarceration.Returnees who have broken Australian law will, no doubt, enter the judicial system. However, they should be dealt with fairly and humanely and not simply given, as Australia's prime minister would have it, mandatory and lengthy maximum security prison terms of isolation.Like the Danish and UK governments, the Australian government should take heed and direct more focus to developing diversionary programs to keep young offenders away from the judicial system, rather that creating new laws to make it easier to incarcerate them. The Australian government should also look at developing prison-based intervention programs to deal with those who have committed acts of violence.For all its posturing and claims of strengthening the country, the Australian government's actions display a timidity its Danish and UK counterparts do not. Simply locking young people away for a long time does nothing to show a nation's strength. Unless we try to understand and address the root cause of young Australians radicalizing, the problem is unlikely to go away and Australia will continue to be under 'high' threat.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-30T22:55:49Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141021145736-nr-pkg-laporte-isis-ginger-jihadi-australia-00003528-story-top.jpg", "id": 4162}, {"title": "Obama on ISIS: Expect 'long-term campaign'", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/14/politics/defense-chiefs-isis/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- Emerging from a closed meeting with the heads of foreign militaries, President Obama told reporters the effort to dismantle the terror group ISIS 'is going to be a long-term campaign.

But if I can offer an opinion as Citizen Jackson rather than General Jackson, it would seem to me, in the long term, the politicsof Afghanistan need to include those who call themselves the Taliban, General Sir Mike Jackson, Former Chief of General Staff of the British Army, said.Jacksons comments come a day after Britain closed its last military base in Afghanistan, bringing an end to the 13-year-campaign that has claimed the lives of 445 British soldiers.Assessing the possible future role of the Taliban is beyond my experience, the General added, but it seems to me, only in that way will you encompass the big tent of Afghanistan as a whole and moveon to that stable and secure Afghanistan, which we would all want for the Afghanis themselves and then in the wider world, in that very turbulentregion. A stable Afghanistan, to me, is a must.Jackson led the British military from 2003 to 2006, as UK troops were stationed in Afghanistan and helped invade Iraq. He said he firmly believes the U.S.-led coalition left the country a better place than they found it.Go back to the autumn of 2000 and the immediate aftermath of 9/11. You had an authoritarian regime which gave succor to AlQaeda. Hardly anybody was educated properly, least of all young girls. The rule of law was non-existent. Government was anything but representative. And to be fair - and I think people must be fair here -when you look at those various aspects of Afghan society now, it is undoubtedly better, he said.The situation in the country remains volatile despite the recent election of an internationally recognized President. The Taliban made territorial gains across Afghanistan this summer and violence marked Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzais first month as the new leader.Jackson acknowledged that security remains a concern, but seemed hopeful that the Afghani forces can handle it on their own as long as the coalition continues to show its support.The important thing is that - those coalition forces who stay after the end of the year are not in a combat role. They're intraining, mentoring, supporting, probably some logistic help as well. And that, of course, has been the political point, certainly in the UnitedKingdom and I dare say in the United States and elsewhere, he said.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:47:11Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028115152-uk-troops-afghanistan-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "id": 3903}, {"title": "U.S. beefs up security at federal buildings", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/28/politics/homeland-security-changes/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) -- Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is ordering more security for more than 9,500 federal government buildings and their 1.4 million daily visitors.Johnson said in a statement Tuesday that the Federal Protective Service's new security measures are a precautionary guard against 'continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere' after two attacks last week on Canada's government.But Johnson didn't reveal the details of the new security measures, saying they'll vary by location.'The precise actions we are taking and the precise locations at which we will enhance security is law-enforcement sensitive, will vary and shift from location to location, and will be continually re-evaluated,' Johnson said in the statement.A Homeland Security official told CNN there is 'no new intelligence' suggesting that U.S. government buildings face additional threats, and emphasized that the changes are a 'precautionary measure' that only apply to buildings secured by the Federal Protective Service.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:50:30Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141008204240-tsr-sot-jeh-johnson-on-isis-threat-00011819-story-top.jpg", "id": 3956}, {"title": "U.S. airdrops give aid to Kobani against ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/world/meast/isis-threat/index.html", "text": "Turkish-Syrian border (CNN) -- In the besieged Syrian city of Kobani, precious medicine rains from the sky.Antibiotics, anesthetics, sanitary supplies and bandages -- all desperately needed to treat local fighters and civilians wounded during the siege of this crucial town near the Turkish border.U.S. airplanes are dropping medical supplies and weapons into this Kurdish city as defenders try to beat back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.Not long ago, Kobani's fall to ISIS seemed certain.

His mission: to develop an Osama bin Laden action figure that projected a negative image of the worlds most wanted terrorist. Mr. Levine, a Korean War veteran, obliged.

The sale ends Nov. 20.The doll, 12 inches tall, presents bin Laden in a white turban, a white four-button robe over a white four-button tunic, off-white pants, and black boots. There are two heads. One shows bin Laden with a stern expression but normal features and skin color. A second head has a demonic red face with black markings and piercing green eyes. The final product would have incorporated both faces in one head, with the first face peeling back to reveal the Satanic bin Laden beneath.Devil Eyes apparently never reached its intended targets. To our knowledge, there were only three individual action figures ever created, and these were merely to show what a final product might look like, a C.I.A spokesman told The Washington Post, which reported on the Devil Eyes project earlier this year. After being presented with these examples, the C.I.A. declined to pursue this idea and did not produce or distribute any of these action figures. Furthermore, C.I.A. has no knowledge of these action figures being produced or distributed by others.The figure up for bid comes from the estate of Mr. Levine, who died in May at 86.

Who are these groups and who are they fighting against?Who are the main players?Mexico's largest and most powerful drug gangs are the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel. The Zetas operate in more than half of Mexico's states and, according to US geopolitical analysis firm Stratfor, overtook their rivals from the Sinaloa cartel in 2012 in terms of geographic presence. Stratfor says the Zetas' brutal violence gave the gang an advantage over the Sinaloa cartel, which prefers to bribe people.However, the Zetas have reportedly been weakened by the loss of their long-time leader Heriberto 'El Lazca' Lazcano, who was killed by the Mexican military in October 2012, and his replacement, Miguel Angel Trevino, who was arrested in July 2013.Other influential and violent cartels are the Knights Templar, the Gulf cartel and the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion.What do the cartels do?Mexico's cartels control much of the illegal drugs trade from South America to the United States.They import cocaine from South America and smuggle it on to the US. Some groups grow and smuggle marijuana, while others have specialised in manufacturing methamphetamines, importing precursor drugs from as far away as China.Most cartels also extort local businesses and bolster their finances through kidnappings for ransom. They have also been involved in people smuggling, prostitution rings, intimidation and murder,Who is fighting whom?Government security forces are fighting the drug cartels in an attempt to re-establish law and order. Rival cartels are at war with each other in bitter territorial battles.There is also internecine warfare between cartel members, and the emergence of break-away factions is not unusual.The Zetas, for example, were first created as the enforcement arm of the Gulf cartel, but later turned on their former allies and have been at war with them ever since. The Knights Templar are an off-shoot of La Familia Michoacana, a cartel that was weakened after the killing of its leader in 2010.Allegiances shift, and former rivals sometimes band together to fight emerging groups.Vigilante groups made up of civilians who say they are fed up with the lack of action by the security forces emerged in 2012 in the western states of Michoacan and Guerrero to fight the Knights Templar.The Knights Templar have accused them of being in league with their rivals from the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion.What has been Mexico's strategy to tackle drug-related violence?Before taking up office, President Enrique Pena Nieto said he would break with the approach of Felipe Calderon, his predecessor.Mr Calderon had deployed the army to go after cartel kingpins and had declared 'war' on the drug gangs.Mr Pena Nieto promised a lower-profile approach aimed at tackling the violence on a local level by setting up a national gendarmerie to take over from the troops.But with growing violence in Michoacan, he too sent the army to back up federal and local police forces.He also struck a deal with vigilante groups, allowing them to keep their weapons as long as they agreed to be integrated in the official security forces.Where are the worst hit areas?According to a study by international think tank Institute for Economics and Peace, northern Mexico continues to be the region worst affected by drug-related violence due to its proximity to the United States, the region's most important market for illicit drugs.But Guerrero on the Pacific coast and central Morelos state have joined the list of most violent states, suggesting the cartels are extending their area of influence.A study by Mexico's Citizens' Council for Public Security and Penal Justice suggests the city of Oaxaca has the highest occurrence of violent crime, followed by the resort town of Acapulco and Cuernavaca in Morelos state.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-23T02:44:11Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72876000/jpg/_72876297_72874909.jpg", "id": 3030}, {"title": "Feds Warn of ISIS-Inspired Threat Against Police, Reporters in US", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/feds-warn-isis-inspired-threat-against-police-reporters-us-n224826", "text": "Federal officials have warned that ISIS-inspired terrorists may be weighing lone wolf attacks against police, government officials and media figures inside the U.S.According to a Joint Intelligence bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security sent to U.S. law enforcement officials, an ISIS spokesman recorded an audio message that urged lone offenders in Western countries to attack soldiers, patrons, and troops  their police, security and intelligence members. Attackers did not need to ask for anyones advice prior to striking, said the message, because such actions are legitimate.An English language translation of the message, which was attributed to ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, was posted on a jihadi forum in late September.Also in September, according to the bulletin, an ISIS supporter posted a document in an ISIS-dominated web forum advocating open source jihad and lone wolf operations by U.S. Muslims against a list of potential targets, including military, law enforcement, FBI personnel, government officials and media figures.The bulletin said officials were not aware of any specific, credible threat against U.S. targets by home-grown extremists inside the U.S. or overseas, but warned law enforcement and FBI personnel to consider additional precautions when conducting interviews.The bulletin also said that ISIS supporters could conduct attacks against U.S. targets overseas with little warning.

'It could be strategic for us only. And also, Turkey is currently accommodating all the civilians fleeing from the town. There are no civilians there.'Erdogan went on to say the U.S. was pushing arms to the PYD, which he accused of affiliation with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., Turkey, NATO and others.'We had said that there are commanders from the PKK in the ranks of PYD fighting in Syria,' Erdogan said. 'We had said that any U.S. aid to this group is going to a terrorist organization.'There had been hopes that foreign airstrikes and airdropped supplies could help Kurdish fighters turn the tide against the ISIS militants. But the onslaught has continued.ISIS has said that at least some of the airdropped supplies made it into its fighters' hands.One of the 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani on Monday drifted away from its target zone, a U.S. official said. The U.S. military said it went back and blasted it.But a video posted on social media shows what appears to be an ISIS fighter next to a parachute bundle. He goes on to show what appears to be the contents of the bundle, including crates of hand grenades and mortar rounds.CNN cannot independently confirm whether the items in the video are from a U.S. airdrop, but according to Anadolu, Erdogan said ISIS had seized some of the weapons.'The rest, they also were seized by another terrorist organization, the PYD. Turkey did never lean toward such military aid and the U.S. did that despite Turkey,' the news agency quoted him as saying.Erdogan further said the Syrian groups that deserve help are the Free Syrian Army and the Peshmerga fighters, the news agency reported.A Kurdish fighter and a media activist in Kobani also told CNN that ISIS militants are pushing toward the western outskirts of Kobani after attacking checkpoints manned by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, and the Free Syrian Army.The attacks forced them to withdraw from the strategic Tall Shair Hill area, they said.But, they said, neither ISIS nor the YPG is able to control the western outskirts of Kobani as fighting for control of the hill rages.Clashes also continue between ISIS and YPG fighters on the eastern outskirts of Kobani, leaving at least five Kurdish fighters dead.ISIS militants were also killed in the clashes, but it was not immediately clear how many.Earlier this week, U.S. airplanes dropped medical supplies and weapons into Kobani to help the city's defenders.Meanwhile, a month of airstrikes in Syria by the U.S.-led coalition -- many targeting ISIS positions around Kobani -- has killed 553 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.A large majority of those killed were ISIS militants, including foreigners, the group said.However, at least 32 civilians were also among those killed between the start of the airstrikes on September 23 and October 22.They included six children and five women, the group said in a statement Wednesday.In total, 464 ISIS militants were killed, the Observatory said. The airstrikes also claimed the lives of 57 fighters from al Nusra Front, a rival Islamist group fighting in Syria.The figures do not include any casualties in neighboring Iraq, where the coalition has also been targeting ISIS forces.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Eliott C.

'We saw that they were looking to test explosives. So they were in the advanced stages of plotting. They had both intent and that capability that put them nearing an execution phase of an attack.'President Obama announced strikes against Khorasan in September at the same time he began the mission to 'degrade and destroy' the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq. At the time, senior officials described the threat posed by Khorasan as 'imminent.'In the days after the strikes, the Pentagon said they believed the mission had 'degraded, damaged, destroyed some of their capabilities,' but didn't specify whether the threat was taken out altogether. No subsequent strikes against Khorasan have been announced by the U.S. military.Olsen said on Tuesday the types of individual who have joined Khorasan -- 'hardened, seasoned veterans' -- made it unlikely the threat had diminished.'I think it's unlikely that threat's altogether been eliminated,' Olsen said, adding that some senior leaders with the group had been killed.Before the strikes began in Syria, U.S. government officials had barely acknowledged the presence of Khorasan, which formed from former al Qaeda members. Sources have said the group has the same aim as ISIS: recruiting and training foreign fighters who could return home to stage attacks.While Olsen said foreign fighters present a broad risk to Americans' security, the potential for so-called 'lone wolf' attacks by unaffiliated terrorists also worries officials.The propaganda circulated by ISIS online could allow Americans to be motivated by the group without ever leaving the country, he said.'The other issue is somebody in the United States, who never leaves the United States, simply sits in their basement reading some of this hateful propaganda that ISIS puts out,' he said.'The concern is that somebody just reads that and they have something in their own mind that makes them think that's what they want to do. They would seek to carry out what we would think would be a relatively small scale attack, but a lethal attack nonetheless.'", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-22T01:01:01Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141021135030-matt-olsen-00000000-story-top.jpg", "id": 2343}, {"title": "Life inside Kobani before Isis attacked  video", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/21/life-inside-kobani-before-isis-attacked-video", "text": "New video footage obtained by the Guardian from inside Kobani shows what life was like for the Kurdish civilians living there just a few days before Islamic State (Isis) attacked the city.

Police stations, hospital, telecommunications center, he told NewsChannel 3s Todd Corillo.He was on a convoy with several Army members and British contractors outside of Baghdad when they came under attack.Ordinarily they would have taken mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAPs) but they werent available that day.We were stuck in our lightly armored SUVs which will take about a bullet from an AK-47 round, Captain Kieffer explained.The convoy was attacked by IEDs, rocket propelled grenades and gunfire.Then an explosively formed penetrator IED ripped through Kieffers truck.It went through the lightly-armored SUV. Traveled about two feet in front of my forehead across the vehicle. Dragged the inside. All the lights were dislodged hanging by the wires, he remembers.I woke up after being knocked unconscious from the blast  just seeing the interior kind of in shambles filled with smoke and expecting the worst I just looked around but all my guys were still moving.Captain Kieffer earned a Purple Heart for his actions in Iraq that day, including protecting his fellow teammates.Hovering over my boss at the time and keeping him down, pushing him down and protecting him because that was all I could do at that point or knew to do at that point.All the men in the convoy survived, but Kieffer still carries wounds from the attack, including traumatic brain injury and PTSD.While he was recovering from the serious pain  his head hurt constantly and his cognitive speed had deteriorated  Kieffer met his now wife Ana Maria in Florida.Her family is from Peru and he made the decision to learn Spanish, something he credits with helping his recovery.It was during that time period that he also began work on his Masters degree in Analytical Math, a process he admits wasnt easy.That was starting 6 months after I was wounded. It took me 7 straight hours to do that first assignment and this is simple things that I used to know but I just sat there for those 7 hours, Kieffer remembers.While juggling all of that, Maj. (Dr.) James Bales, a former teammate of Kieffers on the Air Force Triathlon team, approached him about the Warrior Games.He said Really, youre the best fit and Im going to make you the Ultimate Champion. So I replied, Okay, sure.'The title of Ultimate Champion is based on five competitions: a 50-meter freestyle swim, rifle shooting, a 100 meter sprint, a 30km cycling event and shot put.The most memorable was when my girls ran up on stage and I felt like they almost tackled me at the time and when I came off it was just seeing the gleam in their eye.In late September, Kieffer returned to defend his title.I was really wanting to just show myself and show everyone else that I had come back with a vengeance.He did. Winning the title of Ultimate Champion for the second-year in a row, all while battling the flu.It was pretty rough. I would say I thought I was just having off days but in hindsight I now absolutely realize why I wasnt performing at my best.Now hes getting ready for a new challenge in life.Two years is good. Now I want to let someone else go in- weve got some other Air Force performers in the midst so I think they are going to keep the title with the Air Force but it is time for someone else.Kieffer will soon begin the transition out of the military, but he leaves it as Ultimate Champion in so many ways.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-19T03:59:43Z", "top_image": "http://localtvwtkr.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/promo237764011.jpg", "id": 1590}, {"title": "Frank Gardner: Yemen at risk of civil war, says ambassador", "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-29749046", "text": "The security situation in Yemen is deteriorating so badly the country is at risk of being torn apart by civil war. That is the warning given this week by Yemen's ambassador to the UK, Abdullah al-Radhi.Speaking to the BBC, he said it was imperative that a peace deal was reached quickly between the warring parties and that international donors made good on their pledges of aid.Dozens of people have been killed this week in a series of attacks across the country, most carried out by militants linked to al-Qaeda.A Shia insurgency known as the Houthi movement has reached the capital Sanaa, where its forces have taken over several government buildings, largely unresisted by government troops who went home.The Houthis have also taken control of Yemen's main Red Sea port, Al-Hodaidah and have been fighting their sectarian enemies, the Salafis linked to al-Qaeda.Meanwhile the previous President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, ousted by the Arab Spring protests, has remained in the country and is believed to be still heavily involved in backing one faction against another.In the ensuing chaos, al-Qaeda has been gaining ground and taking territory.An assessment by security consultants Five Dimensions put the situation in stark terms: 'Yemen is moving slowly from a semi-failed state to a fully failed state, and to that extent Yemen is no better than Libya.'The country's ambassador to London says all is not lost but that Yemen urgently needs the billions of dollars in pledged aid to be delivered.'We have seen almost none of it,' said one of his advisers, adding that the 40-strong group of nations known as 'Friends of Yemen' have done little more than talking about the problem.The spiralling situation is alarming neighbours, especially Saudi Arabia, as well as Western nations including Britain.Until the emergence of Islamic State (IS) this summer, counter-terrorism officials considered Yemen to be home to the most dangerous branch of the global jihadist movement.That is because in Yemen, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular (AQAP) has a small number of expert bomb-makers, led by Saudi national Ibrahim al-Asiri.Three times now this cell has been able to successfully evade airport security and smuggle viable explosive devices onto international flights. In 2010 devices reached East Midlands airport in Britain, on a flight bound for Chicago, before an intelligence tipoff led police to where they were hidden in the cargo hold.It is believed that AQAP has now shared this bomb-making expertise with fellow jihadists in Syria, some of whom may have European passports.29 July - Government removes fuel subsidies as part of economic reforms; fuel prices nearly double31 Aug - Houthi leader calls for campaign of civil disobedience18 Sept - Clashes between Houthis and Sunni militias in Sanaa leave 40 dead21 Sept - Houthis occupy key buildings in Sanaa; PM resigns; deal for new unity government agreed.", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:50:35Z", "top_image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/78488000/jpg/_78488914_77725922.jpg", "id": 3105}, {"title": "Central Command general to ISIS: We can hear you", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/06/world/general-isis/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- The top U.S. military commander in the fight against ISIS said airstrikes are working to erode the terror group's capabilities and warned militants that the U.S. military is listening to them.Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, who heads the U.S. Central Command, made those remarks at an event Thursday with the Atlantic Council, which was moderated by CNN anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper.'I'm confident we're having the desired effects,' Austin said of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq aimed at ISIS.'What we want to do is take away the enemies' ability to command and control, his ability to sustain himself, his ability to project combat power and his ability to move forces back and forth across the Iraq/Syria border.'Austin said coalition airstrikes on Wednesday were focused on the Khorasan group. Senior military officials told CNN one of the targets was French bomb-maker David Drugeon. Austin said the military was still assessing the impact of those strikes and would not say whether or not Drugeon was killed.But, he noted that 'any time we can take their leadership out that's a good thing.'Austin said there is evidence that the U.S.-led coalition is gaining the upper hand against ISIS.'They are afraid to congregate in any sizable formation. They know if we can see them, we're going to engage them and we're going to hit what we're aiming at.'Children say ISIS captured, beat them on way home from examsWe can hear you...Austin also said the strikes have significantly degraded the group's ability to communicate and added the coalition was able to listen in on ISIS communications.'As we listen to them, we know that the impact of the precision strikes is demoralizing to them.'The general responded to questions about ISIS militants getting access to warplanes, after the militants were seen on their social media channels with a number of captured aircraft.'I don't think that's currently a significant threat. I know I have some fighter pilots who are hopeful that happens,' he said, drawing chuckles from the crowd.ISIS still has the capability to continue in the fight, the general said, despite what he pointed to as successes from the coalition side.'I think the question is how soon can we get the Iraqi military up to speed to do what they need to do to hold those gains.'Austin acknowledged the ISIS propaganda effort was having a major impact in recruitment for the group.'They really understand the value of dominating the media space. I think they're about as good as I've seen.'He said their numbers of committed fighters was likely between 9,000-17,000, a figure much lower than previous U.S. estimates.Austin echoed other comments from military leaders that the fight against ISIS will be years long but said, 'I don't see it as decades. I see it as years.''Turkey has skin in the game'One member of the coalition has caused a certain amount of controversy. Turkey has limited use of its airspace and military bases despite pledging to help in the effort.'Turkey has skin in the game here, obviously. It's got a set of concerns and we need to be mindful of that,' Austin said, adding that the coalition would 'get it done' with or without more support from the Turks.'The more access and over-flight rights we can get, the better off we'll be.'Tapper asked about speculation ISIS was receiving financing from U.S. ally Qatar, and how successful the coalition had been at stopping the outside funding of the group.'I think some things have been done but I think most folks in U.S. government will tell you, there's a lot more work that can be done and needs to be done,' Austin said.The event was open to the media but cameras were prohibited from filming the session and a previously scheduled live stream of the event by the Atlantic Council was canceled at the request of CENTCOM.CENTCOM said it agreed to the event under the auspices that it was a 'scholarly discussion.' CNN and other broadcast outlets protested the decision.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:31:08Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141104205927-intv-reza-aslan-the-appeal-of-isis-00032202-story-top.jpg", "id": 5835}, {"title": "How do we stop 'lone wolf' attacks?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/27/world/lone-wolves/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the 32-year-old gunman who attacked the Canadian Parliament and killed a soldier last week, had a familiar profile. It is that of a young man alienated from mainstream society, with few friends, without a steady job, drifting from one place to another -- often with a history of petty crime and drug abuse.Then comes the conversion to or rediscovery of Islam, and the adoption of a jihadist mindset, fed by media and online coverage of the West's involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by the well-oiled propaganda machine of groups like ISIS.Whether these young men acting alone (and they are almost always men) should be better described as 'lone-wolf' terrorists or deranged criminals is debatable. 'There is no single, universally accepted definition of terrorism,' says the FBI.In many cases, their conversion to militant Islam is about seeking identity and purpose, or even a sense of adventure. Few of these men have a deep understanding of Salafism, the deeply conservative brand of Islam that's the philosophical underpinning of groups like al Qaeda, and jihad; their writings are often incoherent. Frequently they see radical Islam as a form of redemption from past misdeeds, one that also feeds an existing animosity toward authority and a sense of being 'on the outside.' They blame 'kuffar' (nonbeliever) societies for corrupting them in the first place.Analysis of the backgrounds of dozens of young men who have embraced militant Islam and eventually planned or carried out an act of violence shows that many have had troubled upbringings -- although there is no evidence they are more likely to come from poor than comfortable backgrounds. They get into drugs and petty crime in their late teens or early 20s and often cut contacts with their families. Some fall under the sway of radical preachers; many become radicalized online.Zehaf-Bibeau had several encounters with law enforcement and on at least two occasions was charged with drug-related offenses. The picture emerging from those who knew him is that he was often on the move and given to irrational behavior. His family members said they had not seen him in five years.Zehaf-Bibeau had contact with a militant Islamist in Vancouver, Hasibullah Yusufzai, through social media. But Yusufzai left for Syria early this year, and his influence over Zehaf-Bibeau is unclear.Other lone wolves had troubled backgrounds, tooDays after the Ottawa shootings, another 32-year-old, Zale Thompson, attacked four New York police officers with a hatchet before being shot dead. A loner involuntarily discharged from the U.S. Navy 11 years ago (for issues with drugs, according to the New York police), he was subsequently arrested six times. He converted to Islam two years ago and like many others appears to have been seduced by the online messaging of terrorist groups.Richard Reid, who became known as the 'shoe bomber' after he tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001, was also a troubled young man -- impressionable, dabbling in minor crime and drugs and ending up in a young offenders' detention center before converting to Islam. Once under the sway of militant imams at London mosques, his views quickly became more militant.The leader of the group that tried to detonate devices in London in 2005, Muktar Said Ibrahim, had moved to the United Kingdom at age 14 from Eritrea. He was in constant trouble at school before being convicted of a series of muggings, and estranged from his family. He went to the same young offenders' center as Reid, where he found Islam. After his release he too was influenced by radical preachers in London (as was another in the group).Zehaf-Bibeau and Reid were converts. Like Ibrahim, Mohammed Ali Baryalei was born a Muslim; he arrived in Australia from Afghanistan as a child in the early 1980s. He suffered at the hands of a violent father and was prone to depression. As a young man Baryalei was a nightclub doorman in Sydney's red-light district and no stranger to drugs and alcohol. But then in 2009 came an epiphany: He rediscovered his religion.Whether he was influenced by others or self-radicalized is unclear, but his path to militancy was rapid and dramatic. Baryalei is now thought to be a leader within the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and has tried to get associates in Australia to carry out attacks, according to the federal police.Abdel-Majad Abdel Bary followed a similar path. A DJ and rapper in London, Abdel Bary had lyrics that suggested redemption from drug use through religion. 'It's hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,' he wrote. Abdel Bary claimed he was also seared by the memory of his father's arrest on terrorism charges. 'I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two,' he rapped. Like Baryalei, he also joined ISIS, even tweeting a photograph of himself holding the severed head of one of the slain Western hostages.So can more be done to identify individuals who may be drifting toward an act of terror but who have no connection with any group? And what is the smartest combination of greater surveillance and tougher laws on the one hand -- and prevention and community outreach on the other?De-radicalization programs, such as those in the UK and Canada, have recognized the importance of identifying such individuals before they can do harm. The 'Channel' scheme in the UK includes behavioral therapy, education and jobs training, and drug rehabilitation to help at-risk individuals, and frequently links them with role models. It has taken 4,000 referrals since its inception in 2007.Canada has developed a series describing real stories of radicalization that are used 'to initiate conversations with community groups.' But as Public Safety Canada acknowledges in its latest report 'family members, peers, religious and community figures, teachers and medical and social service providers are crucial partners in recognizing and responding to the subtle indicators of radicalization.'Even so, 'early intervention through a joint community/law enforcement response is no guarantee that a person will not radicalize to violence,' Public Safety Canada concluded.Analysis of such de-radicalization programs is in its infancy; the so-called lone wolves rarely appear on authorities' radar. 'The problem is the type of people who are ready to engage in these (programs) probably aren't the people that the government is most worried about,' criminologist Andrew Silke wrote in The Daily Telegraph last month.There is also argument about whether these programs should be aimed at de-radicalizing (changing someone's beliefs) or more limited disengagement (preventing them from carrying out violence.)Zehaf-Bibeau appears to have been enraged by the Canadian and Libyan governments' refusal to grant him a passport. But three years ago, after being charged with robbery, he asked a court to send him to jail for a year to help him kick his addiction to crack cocaine. A psychiatrist said he was fit to face trial, but Zehaf-Bibeau was sentenced to just one day in jail. His addiction, anxiety and extreme religiosity became a toxic combination -- but the only intervention appears to have been the denial of a passport.In some countries community leaders fear the balance is tipping more toward surveillance and tougher laws, to the neglect of prevention programs and community outreach. The Australian Parliament is debating measures this week that would extend preventive detention and allow police to secretly search properties before notifying the target.Kuranda Seyit, director of the Forum on Australia's Islamic Relations, told the Sydney University journal Honi Soit recently: 'The government has not made an effort to understand why young people have these ideas and thoughts. They've created this invisible war and invisible threat that will continue forever.'The British government has abandoned most of the ambitious Prevent program launched in 2005 to 'increase the resilience of communities to violent extremism' -- the hearts and minds outreach (after groups that were funded ended up being taken over by extremists) and opted for a greater reliance on law enforcement.It is introducing tougher laws to confiscate the passports of those seen as 'would-be' jihadists as well as to force terror suspects to join a de-radicalization program.James Brandon at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence wrote in War on the Rocks last month that 'the UK has effectively given up trying to stop jihadists from being created. Instead resources are being focused on trying to catch jihadists before they can strike.' To Brandon, 'this is an admission of a grave defeat.'But given resource-stretched governments -- scarred by the unpopularity of controversial outreach programs and struggling to keep tabs on 'extremist travelers' to Syria and Iraq -- are increasingly reaching for law enforcement tools to prevent terror coming to their cities, tracking the 'lone wolves' is unlikely to get any easier.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-29T01:53:22Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141022213438-ottawa-lockdown-story-top.jpg", "id": 4023}, {"title": "Did Robert O'Neill really kill bin Laden?(Opinion)", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/04/opinion/bergen-seals-bin-laden-killing/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of 'Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad.' An earlier version of this article appeared in March 2013.(CNN) -- Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill said in an interview with The Washington Post that he was the one who fired the final shot to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011.Two Special Operations sources confirmed to me that O'Neill was one of the shooters in bin Laden's room.But did he really kill bin Laden? And, ultimately, does it even really matter who shot bin Laden since the SEAL raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan was so clearly a team effort.O'Neill has told his story before in a lengthy profile in Esquire in 2013 in which O'Neill was described not with his real name but only as 'the Shooter.'In the Esquire piece, O'Neill/The Shooter was said to have encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad where he'd been hiding for more than five years.The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun 'within reach,' and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. That account was in conflict with the narrative from another raid participant in a wildly successful book, 'No Easy Day.'Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN the story of the Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is 'complete BS.'Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards. They also wounded two other women.The first three SEALs to make it to the top floor of the compound were 'the point man,' 'the Shooter' profiled by Esquire, and Matt Bissonnette, the SEAL who wrote 'No Easy Day' under the pseudonym Mark Owen.What actually happened the night of the raid, according to the SEAL Team 6 operator who I interviewed, is that the 'point man' ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot bin Laden in the head when he saw what looked like bin Laden poking his head out of his bedroom door. The shot gravely wounded al Qaeda's leader.Having taken down bin Laden, the point man proceeded to rush two women he found in the bedroom, gathering them in his arms to absorb the explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests, something that was a real concern of those who planned the raid.Two more SEALs then entered bin Laden's bedroom and, seeing that he was lying mortally wounded on the floor, finished him off with shots to the chest.This account of bin Laden's demise is considerably less heroic than the Shooter's version in Esquire, in which he says he shot bin Laden while he was standing up and only after he saw that the al Qaeda leader had a gun within reach.The SEAL Team 6 operator who spoke to me says there is no way the Shooter could have seen a gun in bin Laden's reach because the two guns that were found in the bedroom after the shooting were only discovered after a thorough search and were sitting on a high shelf above the frame of the door that opened to the room.The SEAL operator also points out there was a discussion before the raid in which the assault team was told 'don't shoot the guy (bin Laden) in the face unless you have to' because the CIA would need to analyze good pictures of bin Laden's face for its facial recognition experts to work effectively. Yet the Shooter in the Esquire story says he shot bin Laden on purpose twice in the forehead.A U.S. official familiar with the details of the raid said the SEAL Team 6 operator's version is in line with what happened. That account 'has it right in my view,' the official said.The SEAL Team 6 operator also tells CNN that the Shooter was 'thrown off' the Red Squadron, the core of the SEAL Team 6 group that carried out the bin Laden raid, because he was bragging about his role in the raid in bars around Virginia Beach, Virginia, where SEAL Team 6 is based. In the Esquire article, the Shooter complains he is receiving no pension, since he left the military four years before the minimum 20 years required to be eligible.After the article appeared, CNN spoke with Phil Bronstein, the Esquire writer who says he passed along CNN's written questions about the Shooter's role in the raid to his story's main character. The Shooter did not respond to those questions.Stephanie Tuck, a spokeswoman for Esquire, said via email the magazine stood by its story.'The Esquire article, 'The Shooter: The Man Who Killed Osama Bin Laden,' in the March 2013 issue, is based on information from numerous sources, including members of SEAL Team 6 and the Shooter himself, as well as detailed descriptions of mission debriefs.'According to present and former members of SEAL Team 6, the 'point man' who fired the shot that likely mortally wounded bin Laden will never 'in a million years' speak publicly about his role in the raid, and they lauded his courageous decision to throw himself on the two women in bin Laden's room.The new account of the bin Laden raid provided by the serving SEAL Team 6 operator is essentially the same as in Bissonnette's 'No Easy Day.' Bissonnette says he was one of the first to run into the bedroom and he saw that the point man's shots had mortally wounded bin Laden. Bissonnette says he then shot the dying al Qaeda leader as he lay on the floor.Present and former members of SEAL Team 6 say they regard Bissonnette as more credible than the Shooter.Balanced against that, according to a story filed by CNN's Barbara Starr last year after the publication of 'No Easy Day,' the head of U.S. special operations, Adm. William McRaven, contacted members of the Navy SEAL team that killed bin Laden. According to Pentagon officials, the SEALs said bin Laden was standing in his bedroom when he was shot, and they believed that he posed a threat because there were weapons in the room. This account tends to bolster the story the Shooter told Esquire.In a previous CNN.com story about the Esquire profile, I noted that I was the only outside observer allowed to tour bin Laden's Abbottabad compound before it was demolished in late February 2012.During that tour, I looked around the bedroom where bin Laden was killed. The Pakistani military officers who were guiding me pointed out a patch of dark, dried blood on the low ceiling of bin Laden's bedroom.This patch of congealed blood seems to be consistent with the Shooter's story that he fired two shots at the forehead of a 'surprisingly tall terrorist' while he was standing up. At the time, the precise location of bin Laden when he was shot was not a matter of dispute.But the blood patch could also be consistent with the account that it was the 'point man' who first shot bin Laden. The point man is 5 feet 6 inches tall and was shooting upward at a tall man as he poked his head out of his bedroom.The compound is, of course, now gone, so it is no longer possible to reconstruct what happened the night of the raid based on forensic evidence.Finally, by all accounts, it was a confusing situation the night of the raid. One of the SEAL team's helicopters had crashed, and there was a firefight with one of bin Laden's bodyguards. All the electricity in the compound and the surrounding neighborhood was off on a moonless night and the SEALs were wearing night vision goggles, which only allowed them limited vision.What seems incontrovertible is that the point man, the Shooter and Bissonnette were the first three SEALs to assault bin Laden's bedroom. But to determine exactly which of them killed him might never be possible.What is certain is that it was a team effort.Five days after the bin Laden raid, members of the SEAL team who carried out the mission briefed President Barack Obama.According to those in the room, the SEAL team commander explained to the President, 'If you took one person out of the puzzle, we wouldn't have the competence to do the job we did; everybody's vital. It's not about the guy who pulled the trigger to kill bin Laden, it's about what we all did together.'", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:48:10Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141106151832-nr-todd-navy-seal-killed-osama-bin-laden-00010524-story-top.jpg", "id": 6107}, {"title": "Surge in fighting threatens Yemen's survival", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/23/world/meast/yemen-violence/index.html", "text": "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen is going through its greatest upheaval since protests erupted during the Arab Spring more than three years ago. Only this time, it's not a cry for democracy but a bitter sectarian battle for power -- pitching al Qaeda and other Sunni groups against Shia Houthi rebels.The Houthi -- whose stronghold is northern Yemen -- swept into the capital, Sanaa, a month ago, where they met little opposition. Since then, they've taken control of Yemen's second port, Hodeida, on the Red Sea.Now they're trying to challenge al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in its heartland in central Yemen. Hundreds of Houthi fighters converged on the provinces of Ibb and al Bayda in recent days. Yemeni Interior Ministry officials tell CNN Houthis have taken heavy casualties because of roadside bombs planted by AQAP.'Houthis are used to military clashes, while al Qaeda uses guerrilla tactics against its enemies,' said Abdul Salam Mohammed, president of the Abaad Strategic Center in Sanaa.Officials estimate that at least 75 people have been killed in fighting since Saturday, the great majority of them Houthis -- including 22 killed by a roadside bomb Monday in the town of Rada'a. There were further clashes in the town Tuesday, with AQAP claiming it inflicted heavy casualties on Houthi fighters.AQAP has taken control of the town of Al Odayn in neighboring Ibb province, as Yemen threatens -- again -- to become a patchwork of rival fiefdoms where the central government has little influence. Al Qaeda claims that some Sunni tribes have joined it in repelling the Houthi incursions.Writing in Al Monitor, commentator Maysaa Shuja al Deen says AQAP is 'forging political alliances with tribes that view the Houthis as enemies... Indeed, the organization has expanded to new areas in response to Houthi control.'Jalal BalEidi, a senior figure in AQAP, said the group will confront the Houthis' advance, in what appears to be a new front in the larger Shia/Sunni struggle across the Middle East.The Houthis have long complained that they have been marginalized and persecuted by Yemen's Sunni majority, and have been involved in series of rebellions since 2004. But never before have they taken so much territory across such a wide area of central and northern Yemen. They are demanding a substantial presence in a new government and a voice in the writing of a new constitution.After taking control of ministries, the state television headquarters and other government facilities in Sanaa last month, Houthi leaders signed a peace agreement with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. But their presence has sparked protests among hardline Sunni parties and groups and has given al Qaeda a new rallying call. Al Deen says the agreement tried 'to legitimize the fall of the capital and cover the truth on the ground, which is the collapse of the Yemeni state and its replacement by militia forces taking control of its streets and expanding militarily to the rest of the country's provinces.'Adding to an increasingly volatile situation, a secessionist movement in the south of Yemen, al Hirak, is stepping up protests in Aden, Yemen's chief port and the largest city in the south.For Washington, Yemen's descent into a conflict of many groups -- whose alliances can change quickly and unpredictably -- is the worst-case scenario. For al Qaeda, it is fertile ground. In some ways, events in Yemen, with outside powers all jockeying for advantage, are beginning to mirror the disintegration of Syria.CNN's Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, with Tim Lister reporting and writing from London.", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-25T22:17:51Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141017194551-tsr-dnt-starr-yemen-terror-threat-00003022-story-top.jpg", "id": 3515}, {"title": "Was Nigeria hoodwinked over Boko Haram 'truce'?", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/11/07/opinion/nigeria-truce-tolu/index.html", "text": "Editor's note: Tolu Ogunlesi is a Nigerian journalist who was awarded the Arts and Culture prize in the 2009 CNN MultiChoice African Journalist Awards. Follow @toluogunlesi on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- On Friday, October 17, Alex Badeh, Nigeria's most senior military official, announced in the Nigerian capital Abuja that 'a ceasefire agreement has been concluded' with the terrorist group Boko Haram.'I have accordingly directed the [military] chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development in the field,' he said.More than one government official followed up with claims that the release of the more than 200 schoolgirls abducted in April was one of the concessions extracted from the terrorist group as part of the truce.Now, more than three weeks later, there's nothing to suggest that Boko Haram is keen on peace. A video released on November 1 shows a man believed to be sect leader Abubakar Shekau denouncing the so-called deal and vowing to continue the campaign of terror. The abducted girls, Shekau taunts, 'are in their marital homes.' The sect has also continued to attack and capture towns and villages in the north east -- including, a week ago, Air Marshal Badeh's home town.Recent history -- a long line of failed attempts to negotiate with, or pacify, Boko Haram -- should have inspired some wariness on the part of the government.In 2011, Kashim Shettima, then Governor-Elect of Borno, the state worst-hit by the violence, said his government would 'offer them amnesty as long as they lay down their arms and embrace peace.'The offer was rejected by someone who claimed to be a spokesperson for the sect, for two reasons; 'first we do not believe in the Nigerian constitution and secondly we do not believe in democracy but only in the laws of Allah.'A few months later, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo travelled to Maiduguri, where the group started out from more than a decade ago, to discuss with the family of Mohammed Yusuf, the sect's founder (whose controversial death in police custody in 2009 triggered the sect's bloody uprising). Barely 48 hours after the meeting, the man who hosted Obasanjo on behalf of the family was shot dead by unknown gunmen.In April 2013 the Federal Government set up a 'Presidential Committee on the Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Conflicts in Northern Nigeria.' Days later a man claiming to be a Boko Haram spokesperson rejected the amnesty. This was followed by a Hausa language audio recording released to journalists in which a man purporting to be sect leader Abu Shekau, said: 'We are the ones to grant them pardon. Have you forgotten their atrocities against us?'Nonetheless, the government pushed ahead with the plan; the head of the committee announced a ceasefire in July. As 2013 came to an end, Boko Haram intensified its activities, culminating in the abduction of the schoolgirls this April.Around July this year, presumably inspired by ISIS, it started to seize -- and hold -- territory.It was against this alarming backdrop that the news of the latest ceasefire emerged, to much relief from around the world.Now that the ceasefire deal has proven to be a sham, several questions linger: What did the government do to verify the legitimacy of the Boko Haram negotiator? What was the plan regarding the swathes of Nigerian territory seized and held by Boko Haram, pre-ceasefire?And, most importantly, why did the federal government, aware of how every previous talk of a ceasefire has turned out, fail to exercise greater caution with this latest one, even in the face of valid concerns by those who should know.The answer to the last question may be found in the fact of Nigeria's brutal, winner-takes-all politics. In the general elections forthcoming early next year, President Jonathan will be seeking a second and final term. It should have been a walkover for the incumbent, as presidential elections traditionally are in these parts. But a potential game-changer emerged last year: a merger of Nigeria's leading opposition parties -- producing arguably the strongest and most determined opposition alliance a Nigerian ruling party has ever faced.Both parties have stridently sought to capitalize on the Nigeria's dire security situation in northeastern Nigeria; the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by alleging that the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) is sympathetic to Boko Haram and is sponsoring the insurgency to undermine Mr. Jonathan's government, and the APC by highlighting the success of Boko Haram as evidence of the incompetence of President Goodluck Jonathan and his government.When the news broke -- at a time when opposition presidential candidates were launching their campaigns, and when speculation was rife that the President was due to declare his own bid soon -- more than a few people saw it as a move by a beleaguered government to counter allegations of incompetence, and shore up its image. The release of the abducted girls would no doubt have boosted Mr. Jonathan's re-election chances.It seems likely that it is this obsession with the approaching elections that fueled the government's shocking gullibility in this matter; allowing it to be hoodwinked into going to town with news of a deal swathed in red flags.The fact that no room was left for doubt or caution is shocking, considering that it is open knowledge that Boko Haram, far from possessing a unified command, is actually a chain of factions varying widely in motivation and method, presumably 'too fragmented to present a common front for dialogue.'The government's blindness -- willful or otherwise -- to that fact should alarm us all. But it's not very surprising.At every turn the Nigerian government -- everything from the president's office, to the military, and intelligence services -- has demonstrated that it is as confused as the rest of us.We see this not just in the desperation, at the highest levels, to believe anything regardless of how implausible it sounds, but also in the supremely careless manner in which information regarding the crisis continues to be managed.If the past is anything to go by, I'm certain we haven't seen the last of the 'ceasefire' announcements.", "source": "http://cnn.com", "date": "2014-11-08T23:39:43Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141107064739-boko-haram-kidnapped-girls-lighter-story-top.jpg", "id": 6003}, {"title": "Rick Perry in London: 'You always sound so darn smart'", "url": "http://cnn.com/2014/10/14/politics/rick-perry-london-speech/index.html", "text": "(CNN) -- In London on Tuesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for more Western involvement in Syria to fight ISIS, and praised the U.S.'s British allies for everything from their love of defending freedom to the boy band One Direction.Perry's foreign policy address at the Royal United Services Institute, a British national security think tank, was greeted with laughs and applause -- especially when he highlighted reasons Americans get along so well with their English-speaking friends across the pond.'It's not just because to Americans, you always sound so darn smart and refined no matter what you're saying,' he said. 'And it's not just because of your many cultural exports from James Bond to Julie Andrews to Simon Cowell to One Direction -- well, that might be a bit of a mixed bag. So many good things in the world began in Britain, and so many good things in the world to this day depend on Britain.'Perry's stop in London comprises the first leg of his European excursion this week, which also includes visits to Germany, Poland and Ukraine. The purpose of his trip is to explore trade opportunities between Texas and the European countries, according to a press release from Perry's office.His decision to travel away from Texas as a second case of Ebola was diagnosed there has drawn the ire of top Texas Democratic party operative Will Hailer, who called the governor an 'irresponsible leader,' according to Bloomberg news.Perry, referring to himself as a 'proud patriotic Texan,' outlined a moral argument in favor of robust Western intervention in Syria by drawing a stark contrast between the 'so-called religious warriors of ISIS' and the 'special strength and character' of Western forces.'To see to it that security is defended -- that is what is required of Western nations and the great alliances we have formed,' he said, admitting that the overseas conflict 'will draw heavily on our wealth, our will and our wisdom.''The plainest imperative of all is the resources we commit to the common defense, holding nothing back if it will better insure our security.'He called out his political adversaries at home -- and even the United Nations -- for their reluctance to get involved in foreign affairs.'This attitude of cultural relativism, it certainly doesn't approve of harsher violent actions,' he said, 'but it does question the right of Britain, the U.S. or other western powers to do anything about it.'Toward the latter half of his address, Perry got emotional about the plight of innocent people living in the Middle Eastern war zone, lowering his voice and pausing periodically for effect.'Who cannot identify with the mother or the father running with their baby, or with an elderly woman who is struggling to keep up with the others?' he asked, drawing similarities between Syrian civilians and victims of bombings over London during World War II. 'Who can't identify with the children who got away but saw what happened to their parents?''And when they look up and they see and RAF or a Danish or an American bomber, they feel precisely as you and I would feel. The sight must seem like an answer to a prayer, a prayer that can be understood in every faith: Save my family. Save my home. Save my village.

'We heard shocking stories of forced religious conversions, forced marriage, and even sexual assault and slavery -- and some of the victims were children.'A 17-year-old kidnapped girl named Adlee recounts how a large bearded man forced her into a home in Falluja, where she was beaten and endured violent sexual advances before escaping two days later, the Human Rights Watch report reads.ISIS forced tens of thousands of Yazidis to flee their homes in August when the extremists stormed many of the community's towns and cities in Iraqi Kurdistan. Displaced families and monitoring groups reported jihadists kidnapped hundreds of Yazidi women and girls, and many were sold or given away to militants as 'spoils of war.'The terror group's 56-page propaganda publication also boasts of a 'massacre against (Kurdish) PKK soldiers' alongside graphic images of slain men dressed in fatigues.

Benjamin J. Sweet, the commandant of the Camp Douglas prisoner-of-war camp near Chicago and commander of the Army post of Chicago, began to hear reports of large numbers of men arriving on trains from Southern Illinois and now milling around the streets and saloons. Detectives also noted that men known to be officers in the Confederate States Army lodged in Chicago hotels. Army detectives working for other commands likewise confirmed the presence of rebel officers in the city.With permission from the War Department in Washington, Sweet detailed one of his camps 8,000 prisoners, John T. Shanks, a now-pro-Union rebel from Texas, to nose around the city to see what was afoot. Posing as an escaped prisoner, on Nov. 3 Shanks first went to Judge Buckner S. Morriss house and spoke with the judge and his wife, Mary, both of whom the Army knew had aided rebel prisoners in escaping. Judge Morris confided to Shanks that there soon would be an uprising in the city.Three days later Shanks made his way to the Richmond House hotel, where he found Confederate officers he knew from their days under Gen. John Hunt Morgan, the Confederate raider. A few of them spilled that an attack on Camp Douglas was planned for Election Day, Nov. 8, led by a Confederate agent, Capt. Thomas Henry Hines. Hines and local armed collaborators would attack the camp from the outside, while prisoners would rise up inside. Freed and armed, the rebel prisoners, aided by sympathetic allies, would then ravage the city and state and disrupt the Union war effort. Shanks reported this information to Camp Douglas commanders.This wasnt the first such plot Sweet had heard about. In previous months he had become aware of the threats to Camp Douglas from combined efforts of local secret anti-government organizations and Confederate agents who were keen to release thousands of rebel troops held in northern prison camps. Initially, he had dismissed or ignored information about collusion between Chicagoans and prisoners. For instance, in May, Army officers in Kentucky had interrogated a recaptured rebel escapee from Camp Douglas, who told them that Chicago copperheads gave money and horses to escaped men and were led by a man named Walsh, who employed his young daughter to smuggle messages to prisoners. But evidently Sweet failed to act on this information.Then, in August, a disgruntled rebel officer in Windsor, Ontario, approached the Army commander in Detroit with news that Captain Hines planned to lead an attack on Camp Douglas later that month, during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Alerted, Sweet hired detectives to locate the Confederates in the city, but the sleuths failed to find them. As Sweet reported, he acknowledged that a secret organization indeed existed in the city, but he didnt think it was armed or plotting open armed hostility. If they were up to no good, he said, I have not yet been able to detect it.Acting on reports from other sources, however, higher-ups in the Army chain of command took the threat more seriously, and reinforced the Camp Douglas garrison as a precaution. As it turned out, Hines and other Confederates had filtered into Chicago during the convention hubbub and were poised to lead local armed conspirators in an attack, but the locals, led by a man named Charles Walsh, got cold feet at the last minute. Frustrated, Hines sent most of his force back to Canada, while he and about 25 others scattered across Southern Illinois to recruit men for another attempt.Sweet then hired more detectives and assiduously worked to uncover plots. As he later reported, his spies inside the camp got wind of a plan to overpower the Camp Douglas garrison on Sept. 19, timed to coincide with the Confederate seizure of the Philo Parsons steamship in Lake Erie in a plot to attack the Union warship Michigan, and free Confederate officers held on Johnsons Island. But prisoners saw his beefed up defenses and called off the effort.Accordingly, experience told Colonel Sweet that the presence of Confederate officers in city hotels boded ill. On the evening of Nov. 6, Sweet chose to act decisively. Sending a courier by rail to Springfield to alert his immediate commander, he warned that Chicago was filled with suspicious characters, among them Captain Hines and other Confederates who had been there in August. The danger was too great to wait for orders. Sweet planned, he reported, to arrest these officers, if possible before morning. The head gone we can manage the body. He intended also to arrest prominent citizens who were part of the plot, of which the proof is ample.In the pre-dawn hours of Monday, Nov. 7, troops from Camp Douglas marched into Chicago, spread out and arrested Confederate officers in the Richmond House. Sweet posted guards around citizens houses and arrested their occupants, among them Judge Morris and Charles Walsh, whom Sweet would later identify as the treasurer and brigadier general respectively of the local Sons of Liberty lodge. Acting on information, at 3 a.m. troops surrounded a house where Thomas Henry Hines was known to be staying. But the Confederate agent escaped capture by climbing into the bed of the houses residents. Claiming to be ill, the lady of the house stayed in bed all day and shielded Hines in the bedclothes. Not finding Hines, officers relieved the guard the following evening and Hines slipped out of the house and Chicago and made his way to Cincinnati, where he hid with friends.As day broke, Chicagoans awoke in astonishment to see troops and ad hoc militia cavalry patrolling the streets, armed with the hundreds of loaded revolvers and shotguns (intended to arm the freed prisoners) seized at Charles Walshs house. Fearing that an uprising might still occur, commanders requested and received reinforcements from other Army posts in the Midwest. In the following days, troops and detectives arrested and interrogated nearly 100 men in the city and downstate Illinois towns; their stories confirmed that the conspiracy aimed to release the P.O.W.s in Camp Douglas. During this crisis, Chicagoans went to the polls on Election Day to cast their ballots.National military and political leaders put the arrested Confederate officers and Chicago civilians on trial by military commission, which was held at Army department headquarters in Cincinnati in the first months of 1865. The trial functioned as a sequel to the military commission trials of the Indiana conspirators held in Indianapolis in late 1864, during the run-up to the fall state and federal elections. The Cincinnati trial of the Chicago conspirators  including Buckner Morris and Charles Walsh  lacked the election-propaganda impact of the Indianapolis trials, but helped the Lincoln administration portray opposition Democrats as traitors, and underscored the boiling tensions that defined the Midwestern states throughout the war.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Stephen E.

We were at the gym at Robins Air Force Base in Houston County, Ga., after a day spent serving on a panel of public affairs chiefs.Youre kidding, I said. Weights clanked behind us. I saw my name on a deployment list, but there was a question mark beside it. All afternoon, my hopes had hung on that question mark.No question sir. You made the list. Youre going to ISAF headquarters in Kabul, he said, referring to the United States-led international force in Afghanistan. He beamed like he was handing me a winning lotto ticket. It was January 2013. I was scheduled to deploy in 15 months.To him, deployment amounted to the opportunity of a lifetime. At that moment, it seemed to me like some surreal theft. Id miss another New England summer, every birthday in my immediate family and my 33rd wedding anniversary. As a 30-year Air Force Reserve veteran, Id spent months away from home, but never deployed to a war zone. So I was a decade overdue. But while the Air Force Reserve asks for volunteers to go overseas, I had assumed they dont involuntarily deploy 53-year-old grandfathers.When I called my wife, Debby, that evening to tell her the news, she said, Arent you a little old for that?I felt old. I took a walk around the gorgeous Georgia base, grateful to be away from the frigid New England winter, feeling alternately numb and angry to be non-vold. The crepe myrtles bloomed and the sun warmed my arms as the notion crept up my spine: Im going to Afghanistan.In the evening, after opening the Gideon Bible to the 23rd Psalm and glancing at the familiar words  The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want   I slept in fits until about 3 a.m., then not at all. In the dark, short, violent movies kept looping in my head. Somebody would burn another Quran and 40,000 protesters  1 percent of Kabuls population  would storm the gate. An Afghan would come to work and start shooting, like what happened when a colleague was killed at Kabul International Airport. Looping, like bad songs that wont stop.The next day, I asked the Reserve Command director, a thoughtful colonel, What are my options?Realistically, Jim, you can retire or you can take the deployment.I wouldnt have volunteered, I surprised myself by saying. But Ill go.So I started a year of intense training holding two opposing notions in balance: I cant believe theyre sending me to Afghanistan, and, What a great opportunity. During one week of training, I learned how to greet someone in Dari, how to kill an enemy using a chokehold and how to save a shooting victims life with quick-clot bandages. Ironically, the Dari greeting, salaam alaykum, means peace be with you. I read thousands of pages of material on the nuances of Afghan culture, how to spot a roadside bomb, how to evade enemy capture. There were also facts I hoped not to need: Grasshoppers, ants and worms are edible; hairy or brightly colored insects are not. I learned that Afghanistan is a nation of minorities, with Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks accounting for about 87 percent of the population, but none representing a majority.Two weeks before flying overseas I attended combat training at Fort Dix, N.J. It was the hardest training Id done, physically and mentally, since officer training school in 1984. On the first day, with Army and Marine trainers yelling above simulated explosions, we learned that the Hollywood notion of low-crawling on your elbows actually is high-crawling. In a real low-crawl, you drag your head or helmet along the ground. I cant low-crawl for more than a few feet without stopping to gasp for air, I discovered, while hauling 70 pounds of body armor and equipment.Our instructor warned us that on the day we conducted urban assault exercises, we would get shot with metal-capped plastic bullets.Only the first shot hurts, he said.I didnt believe him. The night before our turn at urban assault, I stuffed my uniform pockets with padding  a spare notebook, a pair of combat gloves. But our aggressors, all expert marksmen, took great delight in shooting us in the few square inches they knew we couldnt pad. At one point mid-exercise, my M-4 jammed and I stopped moving to slap and snap my weapon. In those two seconds, I got shot on the inside thigh, just below the protective groin cup. It stung hard, and would eventually swell up to baseball size. But my instructor was right: I got shot twice more that day and never felt either bullet.After eight days of travel and delays  from Norfolk, Va., to Pease, N.H., to Germany, Kuwait, Qatar, and a staging base in Afghanistan  I arrived at ISAF headquarters in Kabul, wearing my helmet and heavy body armor, dragging more than 300 pounds of gear. I joined the battle rhythm of working seven days a week, 12 hours a day, at the Media Operations Center as chief of future operations. In my first two months in-country, I lost 15 pounds without trying.At Camp ISAF, beauty and ugliness mingled. Around the perimeter stood a beige, prisonlike concrete blast T-wall, meant to save us from rocket attacks. Razor wire surrounded various compounds within the main camp. Gray dust settled on everything. Across from the ISAF commanders building was the pristine Destille Garden, with green grass, cozy pavilions and a spacious brick fire pit. At the entrance, a waterfall trickled down a series of bowls. Next door sat three faded porta-potties and seven rusty storage containers.In my job, the mundane and the noble mingled. For hours each week, I served as a PowerPoint Ranger, working into the night to align information in boxes and shade one section of a briefing medium green instead of light green on a slide that might flash on a screen for 10 seconds in a crowded conference room. Other times, I helped plan events that were reported globally.On June 25, sweating under the Afghan sun, while two Black Hawk helicopters buzzed overhead, I met Afghan Brig. Gen. Jamila Bayaz, Kabuls first female police chief. Shed been the target of multiple death threats since she started on the Kabul police force 30 years ago, simply because shes a woman. In her gray uniform and black hijab, she spoke with grace and confidence about bringing more women onto the force for the good of Afghanistan, and afterward I felt like Id witnessed a brief moment of something noble.The less-spotlighted people I met here provided another window into courage: One Afghan woman who worked on the ISAF compound to support her family said, The Taliban would kill me if they knew I worked here. She was just one of a parade of Afghan soldiers and civilians who have taken the brunt of the violence in this long war.The beauty and nobility often seem alloyed with something more dangerous. After a news conference, as I was escorting reporters and cameramen to the gate, I asked one reporter if she felt safe living in Kabul. Not lately, after the bombing, she said. We used to throw parties every week, but now we dont meet together in the evenings, except when we have to attend events for work. She was referring to an incident on Jan. 17, when a suicide bomber entered the Taverna du Liban, a Lebanese restaurant popular with Western journalists. After the explosion, two gunmen rushed in and fired on diners. Twenty-one people died. In another scare, on July 3, insurgents launched two rockets that exploded at Kabul International Airport, near the ISAF compound. No one was injured, but they caused millions of dollars in damage.On July 18, 12 of us went from ISAF to a charitable organization in west Kabul to drop off 800 pounds of clothes, school supplies and even some purple lollipops. I was apprehensive. The day before, insurgents had attacked a compound near the airport for nearly five hours. But it ended up being my favorite day in Afghanistan. Then, on Aug. 5, an insider attack at Camp Qargha in Kabul killed Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, the highest ranking American to die in the war, and injured 15 others, including a friend  a tall bodybuilder who seemed indestructible. I cant help thinking that for all the briefings and PowerPoint slides I prepared, my best contributions were dropping off school supplies and comforting some of the Camp Qargha survivors.This mingling of high and low seems as old as war. During my going-away party, I quoted Shakespeares lines from Henry V. When Henrys army is at its worst, sick and rain-soaked, he tells the French messenger, Mountjoy, We would not seek a battle, as we are; Nor as we are, we say, we shall not shun it. I dont think Id trust someone who sought out war without questioning why.

Martin Dempsey told ABC's 'This Week' that the United States had to risk bringing in low-flying attack helicopters to keep ISIS at bay.'The tool that was immediately available was the Apache [helicopter]. The risk of operating in a hostile environment is there constantly,' the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.'You're not going to wait until they're climbing over the wall,' Dempsey said. 'Had [ISIS forces] overrun the Iraqi unit, it was a straight shot to the Baghdad airport. So, we're not going to let that happen.'CNN's Barbara Starr reported October 7 the United States had used the Apache helicopters to push back ISIS forces advancing near Falluja. The aircraft can carry out precise airstrikes but do so at a lower altitude, risking a possible strike by surface-to-air missiles ISIS is known to possess.At the time, Starr reported the United States did not predict ISIS making a direct run for Baghdad. However, there had been general concern that ISIS elements are in the city and around the airport and have been in mortar range for months.Dempsey's comments Sunday clarified for the first time that the Apache was used to protect the Baghdad airport from such an overt threat.The comments came in a wide-ranging interview with ABC's Martha Raddatz about U.S. efforts to destroy ISIS. Dempsey minced few words about the potential scope of U.S. and coalition involvement and the difficulty of targeting ISIS because of their adaptability.Dempsey created messaging headaches for the Obama administration weeks ago testifying before Congress that if he thought ground troops might be needed at some point, he would recommend it to the White House.President Barack Obama has repeatedly insisted he will not put U.S. forces on the ground and will instead work to advise and train coalition and Iraqi forces to fight ISIS.In Sunday's interview, Dempsey conceded that having U.S. troops on the ground, in theory, would help Iraqi forces spot ISIS targets. But he still insisted the U.S. is not at that point.'Yeah, there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes. But I haven't encountered one right now,' Dempsey said.'I'd actually use the example of you know Mosul will likely be the decisive battle in the ground campaign at some point in the future,' Dempsey said. 'When they are ready to go back on the offensive, my instinct at this point is that that will require a different kind of advising and assisting because of the complexity of that fight.'Meanwhile, coalition partners continue to look to the United States for more military might. Obama has long resisted calls for a no-fly zone over Syria. However, Turkish leaders have repeatedly pressed for one.'We want to have a no-fly zone. We want to have a safe haven on our border,' Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that aired October 6. 'Otherwise, all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of Turkey and other neighboring countries.'Dempsey said that while a no-fly zone is not in the works at this point, it can't be ruled out.Coalition airstrikes continued over the weekend in Syria and Iraq. By some assessments, ISIS appeared poised for a victory in the disputed city of Kobani along the Turkish-Syrian border.World leaders have repeatedly warned that should ISIS take the city, residents there could be massacred.'Whether there are still 5,000 people there or not is, is a matter of conjecture,' Dempsey said. 'But I have no doubt that ISIL will conduct the same kind of horrific atrocities if they have the opportunity to do so.'", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-16T17:03:07Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141012150612-nr-intv-us-insists-baghdad-safe-from-isis-00015226-story-top.jpg", "id": 1513}, {"title": "Photos: Syrian civil war in 2014", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/10/middleeast/gallery/syria-unrest-2014/index.html", "text": "A blindfolded man suspected of passing military information to the Syrian government waits to be interrogated by Free Syrian Army fighters Monday, October 6, in Aleppo, Syria.

A former top U.S. counterterror official told CNN Tuesday that the 'imminent threat' from one of the groups targeted in an initial wave of airstrikes in Syria hasn't abated.When Obama announced America's new war in August, he said U.S. air strikes would only take place 'if necessary' and only in Iraq to save civilians from massacres by the marauding Sunni radicals and to protect U.S. personnel.Yet less than three months later, in the newly branded Operation 'Inherent Resolve,' U.S. warplanes have blasted ISIS fighters, vehicles and supply lines in Syria, as well as Iraq. There are more than 1,400 troops in Iraq and hundreds more aboard ships and in nearby countries carrying out airstrikes. U.S. attack helicopters have gone into battle against ISIS in Anbar province.It is indisputable that the campaign has widened. US planes this weekend intensified air strikes on the besieged Syrian town of Kobani, and dropped arms and ammunition to Kurdish forces locked in a struggle for the strategic choke point near the Turkish border.There is every sign the anti-ISIS operation will go on for years. And there is no clear idea of what success will look like, despite Obama's vow to destroy ISIS's 'network of death.'As for Ebola, the Pentagon didn't have a role when the outbreak exploded in west Africa.But soon Obama  warning the deadly epidemic could spark a national security crisis if left unchecked, announced plans to send 3,000 troops to build treatment centers and health care infrastructure. All this came with a caveat that no American soldiers would go near sick patients.Soon, the Pentagon said the number of troops could go as high as 4,000. Then last week, Obama issued an executive order clearing the way for reservists to be called up to fight Ebola if necessary, amid increasing frustration in the White House that US allies have not stepped up.On Sunday, the mission expanded further when the Pentagon revealed it was standing up a rapid reaction squad to leap into action should more Ebola cases emerge on the U.S. mainland  opening the possibility that military officers would be exposed to infected patients for the first time.Deepening U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria seems to be the result of a reluctant conclusion by Obama that the burgeoning threat from ISIS requires a wider US response.But on Ebola, the president is personally and actively demanding the military get more involved.The concept of an emergency treatment team only emerged after Obama ordered more action from his administration in crisis meetings last week as political pressure spiked amid infections on U.S. soil, two senior administration officials told CNN.The White House is walking a fine line. Obama faces skepticism from the Democratic left, which is skittish about new wars and warnings from Republicans that he isn't hawkish enough.The administration insists there will be no 'boots on the ground' in the ISIS conflict and notes an international coalition is helping to bear the burden. Although US involvement may be deepening, it pales in comparison to the 150,000 strong U.S. garrison in Iraq when Obama took office, officials say.Top Pentagon officials privately say the new mission list exposes the folly of current budget cuts at a time when the military is also being asked to bolster Obama's pivot to Asia and strengthen NATO to counter Russia. Top defense officials often cry wolf but they say this time they're not playing politics, and warn that in future they may not be able to answer every time the president calls.It is ironic that Obama is parrying questions on mission creep, after being hammered by critics for 'leading from behind' on Libya and for setting timelines for troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan rather than making drawdowns conditional on battlefield gains.But presidents find themselves sucked deeper into military operations for many reasons  including reverses in the field, temptations brought on by the unique capabilities of the US military or the realization that local allies are deficient. Sometimes, they just have their hands forced by rising political heat back home.Some or all of these conditions may apply to both the Ebola and Iraq operations.But in the ISIS campaign at least, it's clear those in Obama's inner circle have the dangers of Middle East mission creep on their minds. The message is clearly that Obama will use force if necessary  but not beyond certain points.'We make no apologies for being deliberate about the use of force, particularly when it engages the United States in conflicts in a region like the Middle East,' deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN's 'The Situation Room' on Monday. 'The American people want a president who is going to think hard before making those decisions who .... makes sure he is drawing from the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan.'READ: Travelers from west Africa restricted to five U.S. airportsTop officials pushed back hard against the idea that U.S. ground troops will inevitably be drawn into the fight, and comments by Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that US advisors could see combat advisors on the ground alongside Iraqi troops.'That's not come up the chain to anybody at the White House. And I don't anticipate that it will,' National Security Advisor Susan Rice said on NBC's 'Meet the Press' on October 12.CENTCOM commander Gen. Lloyd Austin rejected the idea that U.S. operations around Kobani represented a stretching of the military's orders, saying last week that he was simply exploiting a chance to hit ISIS forces massed in the town.'I think that we really have to remain focused on the first task, and that is to help the Iraqis restore security and stability inside of the country of Iraq; restore their borders; regenerate forces to be able to help them do that,' Austin said.But there are concerns in Obama's political base that things are already going too far.Anna Galland, executive director of progressive group MoveOn.org said that what started off as a humanitarian mission has morphed out of all recognition.'Our members are very concerned by the prospect of a slippery slope in Iraq and Syria back into another open ended war,' she said.Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) told CNN that Americans were war weary and not ready for another widening conflict.'We cannot allow the U.S. to be dragged into another endless war. Since the start of US military action in Iraq and Syria, I have been gravely concerned with mission creep,' Lee said Tuesday.But Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense, said he believed the limited nature of the campaign would mitigate against public war fatigue.'I think now we have recognized that no one is going to transform the Middle East,' Korb said, comparing the ISIS operation to US anti-terror strikes in Yemen and Somalia. 'We just deal with the immediate threats and keep them from getting out of hand.'", "source": "http://www.cnn.com/", "date": "2014-10-22T20:12:13Z", "top_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141021171621-tsr-dnt-starr-isis-us-airdrops-weapons-00000201-story-top.jpg", "id": 2633}, {"title": "An Iraq Veteran's Experience With Chemical Weapons", "url": "http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/an-iraq-veterans-experience-with-chemical-weapons/", "text": "We found chemical weapons my first week in Iraq.At Contingency Operating Base Speicher, I was a lieutenant working in the operations department for an explosive ordnance disposal battalion. We were responsible for the entire northern sector of the country, about 50,000 square kilometers (or roughly 19,300 square miles) of ground touching the Syrian, Turkish and Iranian borders.The information came to me in an otherwise benign email, alongside the dozens of field reports that hit my inbox every hour. After just a couple of days as the new guy on the team, the reports showing the aftermath of vehicles and soldiers torn apart by explosives started feeling routine. Id been expecting them.But this one showed something I didnt see coming: M110 shells, which are American-designed 155-millimeter artillery projectiles. These had tested positive for sulfur mustard, a blister agent.I looked away from my screen, and not 10 feet away from me was Chuck, an Army E.O.D. technician whod already served tours in Kosovo and Afghanistan. He was the kind of noncommissioned officer every lieutenant hopes for: a smart, talented young soldier who trained you up and made you better. I was already relying on Chuck for everything.Here, I turned to him in disbelief.I told him that the team had found chem M110s and that the shells had tested positive for mustard.I persisted. As far as I knew, wed just made the first WMD find of the war.But it turned out there was a lot I didnt know.He cut right to the chase.Chuck turned to me and peered over the eyeglasses low on his nose. He looked at me for a while without blinking.LT, let me let you in on something, he said. We find three or four of those things a week up north here. Everybody knows about them. And nobody cares.I was stunned. You got to be kidding me.As good noncommissioned officers do, Chuck got me up to speed quickly but also didnt hesitate to give me swift reality checks when needed. This was one of those times.Like many Americans, I questioned the rationale for invasion after the United States failed to find weapons of mass destruction in 2003. But now, in February 2007, I was staring at color photos of chemical weapons taken just hours before.Some days, we saw as many as three Americans killed and others wounded in our sector. And the majority of those casualties were caused by makeshift bombs made with high explosives. But every once in a while, one of our teams took a chem hit  where one of the troops was exposed to a chemical warfare agent.Within my first month in Iraq, we had our first chemical warfare agent casualties.One of them was Specialist Richard T. Beasley. (The New York Times is withholding the name of Specialist Beasleys partner at that individuals request.)Chuck went down to check on them.When he got back, we asked about the team and how its members were recovering. Chuck shook his head and described how the two wounded men were sitting on lawn chairs outside their trailer, and were pumped full of opiates so they could handle the pain.Chuck said they were basically in la-la land, thanks to the drugs.Both men were being kept in Iraq instead of being medically evacuated to surgical hospitals in Germany or the United States. We wondered if it was an attempt to keep their wounds hush-hush.Eventually both men recovered, but they bear scars from their wounds and the mustard exposure could mean potential long-term health complications later in life.I found out only recently that my unit had submitted them for the Purple Heart, but a higher headquarters denied the awards.If you served in Iraq and believe you were exposed to chemical weapons or participated in operations involving them, The New York Times would like to hear from you.John Ismay was a Navy explosive ordnance disposal officer who served in northern Iraq during the 2007 surge.

The diarists' names have been changed to protect their identities.Four months have passed since Islamic State took over, and a friend of mine is still in hiding here.He worked as a bodyguard for some judges in Mosul, but after the city fell all the judges left and my friend went into hiding. He moved home so no-one would know where to find him.My friend doesn't move around in the streets much, because IS fighters are almost everywhere in the city.Sometimes they set up impromptu checkpoints and go through people's IDs, looking for people wanted by IS: former security personnel or judiciary, or anyone suspected of arresting IS members before IS captured the city, or anyone who worked for the governorate or in politics.Most of them have left, fearing execution by IS. These kinds of actions have pushed people away from supporting IS. Their criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens.IS members can be seen executing activists in front of everyone in the streets. They wear black fighter outfits, have let their hair and beards grow - some look as if they haven't seen a shower in ages!Every day they increase in number, hold new positions and consolidate their presence, undeterred by the air strikes from coalition forces which do nothing to change things on the ground. It it is actually our reality which has changed and become even more horrific.I teach at a school in my beloved city, Mosul. Like other Iraqi mothers I work to provide some sort of financial assistance to my husband, albeit negligible, to help fend off the hardships of life through such hard times and in such an expensive country.This year, when the summer holidays began, I decided to go to Baghdad to visit some family and relatives there and attend a family ceremony.After the party, when were were all still full of excitement and surrounded by our loved ones, I received news of a curfew back home, and the start of the fighting between government forces and Islamic State rebels.From that moment I spoke to my husband in Mosul every day to find out the latest news.I spent the worst days of my life in Baghdad, the city of my childhood innocence, and where I lived my dreams as a woman in my 20s. I had always been thrilled to live in Baghdad until I got married and moved to Mosul.And yet, for five days of fighting which followed in Mosul, I lived in horror, fear and pure panic, worrying about my husband. I was constantly wondering what was happening and whether I would ever be with him again.After the arrival of the Sunni rebels and IS fighters in Mosul, my husband and I started plotting my return to the city, but all roads were still blocked because of the fighting taking place between Baghdad and Mosul.Cities were falling in hours - not even days - after governmental forces fled or retreated, which left everybody puzzled.After several attempts by my husband and thanks to some of his connections, we managed to book flights from Baghdad to the north.But then another obstacle faced us - I had not brought my children's documentation as I was travelling by land. Yet as we were now flying, it was a must, or we wouldn't be able to leave.Thanks to good thinking and God's will we received the documents via a friend who was leaving Mosul by car and who later flew to Baghdad and brought us the papers.I finally got home to my family in Mosul, shortly after midnight on 20 June. I was shocked and frightened by what I saw in the streets, where armed groups were roaming around. I prayed and fasted for three days.I stayed at home for a while, until I got used to the situation we are now living under, but those were moments I will never forget.A mother's fear for her son at Mosul school", "source": "http://www.bbc.com/", "date": "2014-10-24T05:51:06Z", "top_image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/67373000/jpg/_67373987_09f1654a-e583-4b5f-bfc4-f05850c6d3ce.jpg", "id": 3126}, {"title": "Nobel Peace Prize winners Kailash Satyarthi, Malala Yousafzai call for better Indo-Pak ties", "url": "http://ibnlive.in.com/news/nobel-peace-prize-winners-kailash-satyarthi-malala-yousafzai-call-for-better-indopak-ties/505319-3.html", "text": "New Delhi: Friday marked a momentous day in the history of India and Pakistan when two of their child rights activists - Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai, respectively - won the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize 2014.The joint award could not have come at a more opportune time. The month of October had been especially grim for India and Pakistan over the ceasefire violations which resulted in heavy civilian casualties on both sides.The Nobel committee acknowledged in its citation that the Peace award was for 'a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism'.Thanking the committee for choosing her and Satyarthi, Malala said the award was a step towards building peaceful ties between India and Pakistan.'I had a phone call with Kailash Satyarthi. We will try to build strong relation between India and Pakistan. The situation on the border is not good nowadays. I want both the countries to have dialogue. I would request both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to join us when we receive the award,' she said at a press conference in Birmingham, UK.Satyarthi echoed Malala's sentiments. 'I know her (Malala) personally. I will ask her that besides our fight for child rights and education for children, particularly for girls, we have to go a step further and work for peace in our sub-continent. For India and Pakistan, it is very important that our children are born and live in peace,' Satyarthi said.Both Satyarthi and Malala have been spearheading campaigns for child rights in India and Pakistan, respectively.Satyarthi has been running the Bachpan Bachao Andolan which has rescued lakhs of children from forced labour in a number of states including Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Delhi.

What is distinctive about the threat Canada has faced, and what is different about the way it tackles violent extremism?As you step through the front door of Canada's parliament building, the first thing you see is a bullet hole on the floor.Amid the gothic splendour of the Centre Block, it serves as a jarring reminder of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's assault on the building.Soon the parliamentarians who barricaded themselves in offices and meeting rooms during his rampage will vote on 'much strengthened' surveillance and detention powers promised by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in the aftermath of the shooting.But for all the headlines about it representing a loss of national innocence, Canada is hardly a stranger to the threat of political violence.Nor has its government previously neglected to pass laws aimed at tackling violent extremists. Indeed, just weeks before Zehaf-Bibeau's rampage, ministers unveiled plans to give federal security agencies more powers to track suspects.As in other Western nations following the attacks of 11 September 2001, Canadian society witnessed fierce debates about the power and scope of the security services, with supporters of new legislation insisting it was necessary to safeguard the public and critics complaining that it trampled on civil liberties.The Anti-Terrorism Act, passed by the Canadian parliament in December 2001, introduced new powers and penalties designed, in part, to prevent 9/11-style attacks.It is possible that the most recent violence will again encourage some people 'to err more on the side of collective safety', suggests Prof Christian Leuprecht, a security expert at the Royal Military College of Canada. Others will conclude the balance already has been tipped far enough against fundamental freedoms.Still, Canada has never before experienced a week like this one. The shootings around Parliament Hill came a day after another Muslim convert killed a soldier in Quebec.Among some Islamist militants, there had at one stage been a sense that Canada - which did not declare war on Iraq in 2003 - was 'not a real high-value target', says Fen Osler Hampson, director of the global security and politics programme at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.Canada's participation in the attacks on Islamic State may have changed this.Nonetheless, the country has produced a number of potentially deadly terrorist plots.In 2006, the so-called 'Toronto 18' planned to detonate truck bombs around Toronto and take hostages including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, in al-Qaeda-inspired plot. Some 11 men were convicted of terror-related offences.As recently as 18 September, Hiva Alizadeh was jailed for attempting to organise a jihadist cell in Ottawa. Tunisian Chiheb Esseghaier and Palestinian Raed Jaser are awaiting trial over an alleged plan to derail a train between Toronto and New York.Others have been involved in overseas terrorism. Since 9/11, dozens of Canadian citizens are thought to have travelled to the Middle East and beyond to join militant groups:There are some recurring characteristics among Canadian Islamists, says Mr Hampson. Compared with their counterparts from other Western counties, they are more likely to be socially marginalised, often unemployed individuals, who often act alone. Many are converts.'In Canada, Muslims are much better integrated in society and they are much more upwardly mobile for the most part,' says Mr Hampson. 'They've adopted the identity of being Canadian and being tolerant.'Those who do not stand out.Canada encountered violent extremism in the years before 9/11 - the Front de Liberation du Quebec was responsible for around 160 violent incidents and eight deaths between 1963 and 1970. But the attacks in New York were the impetus for Canada's Anti-Terrorism Act.This legislation defined 'terrorist activity', created a list of 'terrorist entities', and created a number of new criminal offences including for example instructing someone to carry out an attack.Two temporary measures were also passed - one allowing for preventive detention in some circumstances, another permitting hearings in which a judge could compel someone with information about a possible attack to answer questions before a court. Both expired in 2007 but have subsequently been reinstated.Further legislation, which came into effect in 2013, makes it illegal to leave Canada, or to attempt to do so, with the intention of carrying out an attack.Last week, before the attacks, Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney said the government was preparing to boost the powers of Canada's spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).He said the reforms would allow CSIS to monitor suspects when they travel abroad in order to pursue prosecutions, but the specifics of the proposals have not yet been outlined.The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that government officials were considering whether CSIS should be allowed to use 'threat-diminishment' tactics, including 'aggressively interviewing' a parent or employer of a young suspect who has not been charged.On Thursday, Mr Harper said the law must be strengthened 'in the area of surveillance, detention and arrest'.It is an issue that will divide opinion. Mr Hampson says that, despite a civil libertarian streak, most Canadians will conclude that 'we have to live in the real world'.By contrast, Prof Kent Roach at the University of Toronto, says that the 'Canadian offences of leaving Canada to engage in various forms of terrorism actually places Canada ahead of both the UK and the US'.The problem with the law is that it is not being properly enforced, not that it does not go far enough, he believes.It is a debate that will serve for some time yet as a reminder of Canada's most traumatic week in recent memory.
